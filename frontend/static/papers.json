However, nodes and edges bear realtime coordinates, making it difficult to organize them into discrete timeslices, without a loss of temporal information due to projection. Eventbased dynamic graph drawing rejects the notion of a timeslice and allows each node and edge to retain its own realvalued time coordinate. While existing work has demonstrated clear advantages for this approach, they come at a running time cost. We investigate the problem of accelerating eventbased layout to make it more competitive with existing layout techniques. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and experimental evaluation of MultiDynNoS, the first multilevel eventbased graph layout algorithm. We consider three operators for coarsening and placement, inspired by Walshaw, GRIP and FM3, which we couple with an eventbased graph drawing algorithm. We also propose two extensions to the core algorithm: AutoTau and Bend Transfer. We perform two experiments: first, we compare MultiDynNoS variants to existing stateoftheart dynamic graph layout approaches; second, we investigate the impact of each of the proposed algorithm extensions. MultiDynNoS proves to be competitive with existing approaches, and the proposed extensions achieve their design goals and contribute in opening new research directions.",

                  "abstract": "In social networks, individuals decisions are strongly influenced by recommendations from their friends, acquaintances, and favorite renowned personalities. The popularity of online social networking platforms makes them the prime venues to advertise products and promote opinions. The Influence Maximization (IM) problem entails selecting a seed set of users that maximizes the influence spread, i.e., the expected number of users positively influenced by a stochastic diffusion process triggered by the seeds. Engineering and analyzing IM algorithms remains a difficult and demanding task due to the NP-hardness of the problem and the stochastic nature of the diffusion processes. Despite several heuristics being introduced, they often fail in providing enough information on how the network topology affects the diffusion process, precious insights that could help researchers improve their seed set selection. In this paper, we present VAIM, a visual analytics system that supports users in analyzing, evaluating, and comparing information diffusion processes determined by different IM algorithms. Furthermore, VAIM provides useful insights that the analyst can use to modify the seed set of an IM algorithm, so to improve its influence spread. We assess our system by: (i)(i) a qualitative evaluation based on a guided experiment with two domain experts on two different data sets; (ii)(ii) a quantitative estimation of the value of the proposed visualization through the ICE-T methodology by Wall et al. (IEEE TVCG - 2018). The twofold assessment indicates that VAIM effectively supports our target users in the visual analysis of the performance of IM algorithms.",

                  "abstract": "Dynamic networks can be challenging to analyze visually, especially if they span a large time range during which new nodes and edges can appear and disappear. Although it is straightforward to provide interfaces for visualization that represent multiple states of the network (i.e., multiple timeslices) either simultaneously (e.g., through small multiples) or interactively (e.g., through interactive animation), these interfaces might not support tasks in which disjoint timeslices need to be compared. Since these tasks are key for understanding the dynamic aspects of the network, understanding which interactive visualizations best support these tasks is important. We present the results of a series of laboratory experiments comparing two traditional approaches (small multiples and interactive animation), with a more recent approach based on interactive timeslicing. The tasks were performed on a large display through a touch interface. Participants completed 24 trials of three tasks with all techniques. The results show that interactive timeslicing brings benefit when comparing distant points in time, but less benefits when analyzing contiguous intervals of time.",

                  "abstract": "Dynamic graph drawing algorithms take as input a series of timeslices that standard, force-directed algorithms can exploit to compute a layout. However, often dynamic graphs are expressed as a series of events where the nodes and edges have real coordinates along the time dimension that are not confined to discrete timeslices. Current techniques for dynamic graph drawing impose a set of timeslices on this event-based data in order to draw the dynamic graph, but it is unclear how many timeslices should be selected: too many timeslices slows the computation of the layout, while too few timeslices obscures important temporal features, such as causality. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel model for drawing event-based dynamic graphs and the first dynamic graph drawing algorithm, DynNoSlice, that is capable of drawing dynamic graphs in this model. DynNoSlice is an offline, force-directed algorithm that draws event-based, dynamic graphs in the space-time cube (2D+time). We also present a method to extract representative small multiples from the space-time cube. To demonstrate the advantages of our approach, DynNoSlice is compared with state-of-the-art timeslicing methods using a metrics-based experiment. Finally, we present case studies of event-based dynamic data visualised with the new model and algorithm.",

Representation learning presents an attractive opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of users and items, where each user/item can be embedded in a Euclidean space and its evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space. However, existing dynamic embedding methods generate embeddings only when users take actions and do not explicitly model the future trajectory of the user/item in the embedding space. Here we propose JODIE, a coupled recurrent neural network model that learns the embedding trajectories of users and items. JODIE employs two recurrent neural networks to update the embedding of a user and an item at every interaction. Crucially, JODIE also models the future embedding trajectory of a user/item. To this end, it introduces a novel projection operator that learns to estimate the embedding of the user at any time in the future. These estimated embeddings are then used to predict future user-item interactions. To make the method scalable, we develop a t-Batch algorithm that creates time-consistent batches and leads to 9x faster training. We conduct six experiments to validate JODIE on two prediction tasks---future interaction prediction and state change prediction---using four real-world datasets.

However, it is challenging to analyze, especially if it has many actors, connections or if the covered timespan is large with rapidly changing links (e.g., months of changes with changes at second resolution). In these analyses one would often like to compare many periods of time to others, without having to look at the full timeline. To support this kind of analysis we designed and implemented a technique and system to visualize this dynamic data. The Dynamic Network Plaid (DNP) is designed for large displays and based on user-generated interactive timeslicing on the dynamic graph attributes and on linked provenance-preserving representations. We present the technique, interface and the design/evaluation with a group of public health researchers investigating non-suicidal self-harm picture sharing in Instagram.",

Visualizations are described as operations on the cube, which transform the cubes 3D shape into readable 2D visualizations. Operations include extracting subparts of the cube, flattening it across space or time or transforming the cubes geometry and content. We introduce a taxonomy of elementary spacetime cube operations and explain how these operations can be combined and parameterized. The generalized spacetime cube has two properties: (1) it is purely conceptual without the need to be implemented, and (2) it applies to all datasets that can be represented in two dimensions plus time (e.g. geospatial, videos, networks, multivariate data). The proper choice of spacetime cube operations depends on many factors, for example, density or sparsity of a cube. Hence, we propose a characterization of structures within spacetime cubes, which allows us to discuss strengths and limitations of operations. We finally review interactive systems that support multiple operations, allowing a user to customize his view on the data. With this framework, we hope to facilitate the description, criticism and comparison of temporal data visualizations, as well as encourage the exploration of new techniques and systems.

Addressing these challenges is needed for big data to provide valuable insights and novel solutions for business, security, social media, and healthcare.

This paper describes 15 strategies for sharpening analytic focus that analysts can use to reduce the data volume and pattern variety. Four groups of strategies are proposed: (1) extraction strategies, (2) temporal folding, (3) pattern simplification strategies, and (4) iterative strategies. For each strategy, we provide examples of the use and impact of this strategy on volume and/or variety. Examples are selected from 20 case studies gathered from either our own work, the literature, or based on email interviews with individuals who conducted the analyses and developers who observed analysts using the tools. Finally, we discuss how these strategies might be combined and report on the feedback from 10 senior event sequence analysts.",

Firstly, an efficient method for approximating the n-body calculations used in Force Directed Placement (FDP) is described, exploiting use of a multilevel scheme to approximate distance between groups of vertices much like the Barnes Hut Octree. The method suggests better representation of the graphs underlying relationships. In experiments this algorithm, referred to as Multilevel Global Force (MGF), reduces running time by an average of 40% compared to the popular Barnes Hut Octree approximation method.  Secondly, optimisation methods used in static graph drawing (such as multilevel and approximation schemes) are adapted for use in dynamic graph drawing, simultaneously improving the quality of layouts produced and reducing the complexity such that large graphs with thousands of vertices can be drawn in interactive time.  Thirdly, several techniques are introduced for incorporating graph changes into the dynamic graph drawing to differing extents, allowing the viewer to decide whether the ongoing layout should preserve the original layout or prioritise the graph changes.  The works are combined to form an efficient multilevel dynamic graph drawing algorithm.",

The difficulty in using EHRs for research purposes, however, is that both patient selection and record analysis must be conducted across very large, and typically very noisy datasets. Our previous work introduced EventFlow, a visualization tool that transforms an entire dataset of temporal event records into an aggregated display, allowing researchers to analyze population-level patterns and trends. As datasets become larger and more varied, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to provide a succinct, summarizing display. This paper presents a series of user-driven data simplifications that allow researchers to pare event records down to their core elements. Furthermore, we present a novel metric for measuring visual complexity, and a language for codifying disjoint strategies into an overarching simplification framework. These simplifications were used by real-world researchers to gain new and valuable insights from initially overwhelming datasets.",

This paper reports on a two-part user study, as well as a series of early tests and interviews with clinical researchers, that informed the development of two temporal query interfaces: a basic, menu-based interface and an advanced, graphic-based interface. While the scope of temporal query is very broad, this work focuses on two particularly complex and critical facets of temporal event sequences: intervals (events with both a start time and an end time), and the absence of an event. We describe how users encounter a common set of difficulties when specifying such queries, and propose solutions to help overcome them.

Stress models are often employed in this situation. However, the traditional full stress model is not scalable due to its reliance on an initial all-pairs shortest path calculation. A number of fast approximation algorithms have been proposed. While they work well for some graphs, the results are less satisfactory on graphs of intrinsically high dimension, because some nodes may be placed too close together, or even share the same position. We propose a solution, called the maxent-stress model, which applies the principle of maximum entropy to cope with the extra degrees of freedom. We describe a force-augmented stress majorization algorithm that solves the maxent-stress model. Numerical results show that the algorithm scales well, and provides acceptable layouts for large, nonrigid graphs. This also has potential applications to scalable algorithms for statistical multidimensional scaling (MDS) with variable distances.",

The graphs are drawn side-byside from left to right as a sequence of narrow stripes that are placed perpendicular to the horizontal time line. The hierarchically organized vertices of the graphs are arranged on vertical, parallel lines that bound the stripes; directed edges connect these vertices from left to right. To address massive overplotting of edges in huge graphs, we employ a splatting approach that transforms the edges to a pixel-based scalar field. This field represents the edge densities in a scalable way and is depicted by non-linear color mapping. The visualization method is complemented by interaction techniques that support data exploration by aggregation, filtering, brushing, and selective data zooming.

Questions used in the experiment were selected to test both local and global properties of graph evolution over time. The data sets used in this experiment were derived from standard benchmark data sets of the information visualization community. We found that small multiples gave significantly faster performance than animation overall and for each of our five graph comprehension tasks. In addition, small multiples had significantly more errors than animation for the tasks of determining sets of nodes or edges added to the graph during the same timeslice, although a positive time-error correlation coefficient suggests that, in this case, faster responses did not lead to more errors. This result suggests that, for these two tasks, animation is preferable if accuracy is more important than speed. Preserving the mental map under either the animation or the small multiples condition had little influence in terms of error rate and response time.",

The online community represents a prototypical example of a complex evolving social network in which connections between users are established over time by online messages. We study the evolution of a variety of properties since the inception of the system, including how users create, reciprocate, and deepen relationships with one another, variations in users gregariousness and popularity, reachability and typical distances among users, and the degree of local redundancy in the system. Results indicate that the system is a small world characterized by the emergence, in its early stages, of a hub-dominated structure with heterogeneity in users behavior. We investigate whether hubs are responsible for holding the system together and facilitating information flow, examine first-mover advantages underpinning users ability to rise to system prominence, and uncover gender differences in users gregariousness, popularity, and local redundancy. We discuss the implications of the results for research on system use and evolving social networks, and for a host of applications, including information diffusion, communities of practice, and the security and robustness of information systems.  2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The multilevel process groups vertices to form clusters, uses the clusters to define a new graph and is repeated until the graph size falls below some threshold. The coarsest graph is then given an initial layout and the layout is successively refined on all the graphs starting with the coarsest and ending with the original. In this way the multilevel algorithm both accelerates and gives a more global quality to the force-directed placement. The algorithm can compute both 2 & 3 dimensional layouts and we demonstrate it on a number of examples ranging from 500 to 225,000 vertices. It is also very fast and can compute a 2D layout of a sparse graph in around 30 seconds for a 10,000 vertex graph to around 10 minutes for the largest graph. This is an order of magnitude faster than recent implementations of force-directed placement algorithms.",

The basic straight-edge graph layout problem is to find spatial positions for the nodes of an input graph that maximize some measure of desirability. When graph layout is intended for human consumption, we call this measure of desirability an aesthetic. We seek an algorithm that produces graph layouts of high aesthetic quality not only for general graphs, but also for specific classes of graphs, such as trees and directed acyclic graphs.    The Aesthetic Graph Layout (AGLO) approach described in this paper models graph layout as a multiobjective optimization problem, where the value of a layout is determined by multiple user-controlled layout aesthetics.    The current AGLO algorithm combines the power and flexibility of the simulated annealing approach of Davidson and Harel (1989) with the relative speed of the method of Fruchterman and Reingold (1991). In addition, it is more general, and incorporates several new layout aesthetics to support new layout styles. Using these aesthetics, we are able to produce pleasing displays for graphs on which these other methods flounder.",

The usefulness of these graph representations depends on the quality of the layout of the graphs. Automatic graph layout, which can release humans from graph drawing, is now available in several visualization systems. Most automatic layout facilities take a purely combinatorial description of a graph and produce a layout of the graph; these methods are called layout creation methods. For interactive systems, another kind of layout is needed: a facility which can adjust a layout after a change is made by the user or by the application. Although layout adjustment is essential in interactive systems, most existing layout algorithms are designed for layout creation. The use of a layout creation method for layout adjustment may totally rearrange the layout and thus destroy the users mental map of the diagram; thus a set of layout adjustment methods, separate from layout creation methods, is needed. This paper discusses some layout adjustment methods and the preservation of the mental map of the diagram. First, several models are proposed to make the concept of mental map more precise. Then two kinds of layout adjustments are described. One is an algorithm for rearranging a diagram to avoid overlapping nodes, and the other is a method aimed at changing the focus of interest of the user without destroying the mental map. Next, some experience with visualization systems in which the techniques have been employed is also described.",

Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-two illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided.

Research on stereoscopic devices has shown that three-dimensional representation can improve accuracy in specific tasks (e.g., network visualization). Yet, so far the field has remained mute on the underlying mechanism. Our study systematically investigates the differences in user perception between a regular monitor and a mixed reality device. In a real-life within-subject experiment in the field with twenty-eight investment bankers, we assessed subjective and objective task performance with two- and three-dimensional systems, respectively. We tested accuracy with regard to position, size, and color using single and combined tasks. Our results do not show a significant difference in accuracy between mixed-reality and standard 2D monitor visualizations.",

So-called firm-to-firm transaction networks are valuable in analyzing a market or an economy. However, such detailed and complete data is seldom available. In this work, we aim at supporting economists by reusing available financial information from different sources at different levels of detail and completeness. With our technique, experts domain knowledge can be fused together with publicly available information to extract a representative, coherent instance of the transaction network. Supporting underspecification is important, as experts may develop partial econometric models. Our technique fills such blanks by systematically guesstimating missing information. Our approach builds upon formal foundations of satisfiability modulo theories and thus obtained transaction networks respect constraints imposed by domain knowledge and input data sources. We outline a taxonomy of general data types in the domain, and we programmatically construct formal predicates describing them. We demonstrate both guestimation of missing information of a transaction network and validation of external, expert-provided models. Finally, we investigate feasibility and performance of the advocated technique over a fragment of the Austrian economy.",

Previous studies have proposed numerous methods to produce flow maps. However, how to evaluate the usability of flow maps has not been well documented. In this study, we combined eye-tracking and questionnaire methods to evaluate the usability of flow maps through comparisons between (a) straight lines and curves and (b) line thicknesses and color gradients. The results show that curved flows are more effective than straight flows. Maps with curved flows have more correct answers, fixations, and percentages of fixations in areas of interest. Furthermore, we find that the curved flows require longer finish times but exhibit smaller times to first fixation than straight flows. In addition, we find that using color gradients to indicate the flow volume is significantly more effective than the application of different line thicknesses, which is mainly reflected by the presence of more correct answers in the color-gradient group. These empirical studies could help improve the usability of flow maps employed to visualize geo-data.",

Cartographers have developed design principles in manual cartography for origin-destination flow maps to reduce overlaps and increase readability. These design principles are identified and documented using a quantitative content analysis of 97 geographic origin-destination flow maps without branching or merging flows. The effectiveness of selected design principles is verified in a user study with 215 participants. Findings show that (a) curved flows are more effective than straight flows, (b) arrows indicate direction more effectively than tapered line widths, and (c) flows between nodes are more effective than flows between areas. These findings, combined with results from user studies in graph drawing, conclude that effective and efficient origin-destination flow maps should be designed according to the following design principles: overlaps between flows are minimized; symmetric flows are preferred to asymmetric flows; longer flows are curved more than shorter or peripheral flows; acute angles between crossing flows are avoided; sharp bends in flow lines are avoided; flows do not pass under unconnected nodes; flows are radially distributed around nodes; flow direction is indicated with arrowheads; and flow width is scaled with represented quantity.",

When mapping these aggregations, the map projection must inevitably distort relationships. This distortion can impact the readers ability to compare count and density measures across the map. Spatial binning, particularly via hexagons, is becoming a popular technique for displaying aggregate measures of point data sets. Increasingly, we see questionable use of the technique without attendant discussion of its hazards. In this work, we discuss when and why spatial binning works and how mapmakers can better understand the limitations caused by distortion from projecting to the plane. We introduce equations for evaluating distortions impact on one common projection (Web Mercator) and discuss how the methods used generalize to other projections. While we focus on hexagonal binning, these same considerations affect spatial bins of any shape, and more generally, any analysis of geographic data performed in planar space.",

A wide variety of methods and tools for analysis of movement data has been developed in recent years. They allow analysts to look at the data from different perspectives and fulfil diverse analytical tasks. Visual displays and interactive techniques are often combined with computational processing, which, in particular, enables analysis of a larger number of data than would be possible with purely visual methods. Visual analytics leverages methods and tools developed in other areas related to data analytics, particularly statistics, machine learning and geographic information science. We present an illustrated structured survey of the state of the art in visual analytics concerning the analysis of movement data. Besides reviewing the existing works, we demonstrate, using examples, how different visual analytics techniques can support our understanding of various aspects of movement.",

Many companies use competitive intelligence to identify risks and opportunities within markets. Point of sale data that retailers share with vendors is of critical importance in developing competitive intelligence. However, existing tools do not easily enable the analysis of such large and complex data. therefore, new approaches are needed in order to facilitate better analysis and decision making. In this paper, we present MarketAnalyzer, an interactive visual analytics system designed to allow vendors to increase their competitive intelligence. MarketAnalyzer utilizes pixelbased matrices to present sale data, trends, and market share growths of products of the entire market within a single display. These matrices are augmented by advanced underlying analytical methods to enable the quick evaluation of growth and risk within market sectors. Furthermore, our system enables the aggregation of point of sale data in geographical views that provide analysts with the ability to explore the impact of regional demographics and trends. Additionally, overview and detailed information is provided through a series of coordinated multiple views. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we provide two usecase scenarios as well as feedback from market analysts.",

Especially, supporting the analysis of datasets with a temporal dimension remains a significant challenge. Many techniques for the exploration of spatiotemporal data have been developed, but they prove to be only of limited use when applied to temporal origindestination datasets. We present Flowstrates, a new interactive visualization approach in which the origins and the destinations of the flows are displayed in two separate maps, and the changes over time of the flow magnitudes are represented in a separate heatmap view in the middle. This allows the users to perform spatial visual queries, focusing on different regions of interest for the origins and destinations, and to analyze the changes over time provided with the means of flow ordering, filtering and aggregation in the heatmap. In this paper, we discuss the challenges associated with the visualization of temporal origindestination data, introduce our solution, and present several usage scenarios showing how the tool we have developed supports them.",

The ability to estimate is an important skill in daily life. More and more leading businesses today use estimation questions in interviews to test applicants abilities to think on their feet. Guesstimation enables anyone with basic math and science skills to estimate virtually anything--quickly--using plausible assumptions and elementary arithmetic.Lawrence Weinstein and John Adam present an eclectic array of estimation problems that range from devilishly simple to quite sophisticated and from serious real-world concerns to downright silly ones. How long would it take a running faucet to fill the inverted dome of the Capitol? What is the total length of all the pickles consumed in the US in one year? What are the relative merits of internal-combustion and electric cars, of coal and nuclear energy? The problems are marvelously diverse, yet the skills to solve them are the same. The authors show how easy it is to derive useful ballpark estimates by breaking complex problems into simpler, more manageable ones--and how there can be many paths to the right answer. The book is written in a question-and-answer format with lots of hints along the way. It includes a handy appendix summarizing the few formulas and basic science concepts needed, and its small size and French-fold design make it conveniently portable. Illustrated with humorous pen-and-ink sketches, Guesstimation will delight popular-math enthusiasts and is ideal for the classroom.",

In a modern economy, large structures of cross-corporation, cross-border shareholder relationships exist, forming complex networks. These networks are often difficult to analyze with traditional approaches. An efficient visualization of the networks helps to reveal the interdependent shareholding formations and the controlling patterns. In this paper, we propose an effective visualization tool that supports the financial analyst in understanding complex shareholding networks. We develop an interactive visual analysis system by combining state-of-the-art visualization technologies with economic analysis methods. Our system is capable to reveal patterns in large corporate shareholder networks, allows the visual identification of the ultimate shareholders, and supports the visual analysis of integrated cash flow and control rights. We apply our system on an extensive real-world database of shareholder relationships, showing its usefulness for effective visual analysis.",

The goals of the report are to increase awareness of large data sets problems and to contribute simple graphical methods that address some of the problems. The graphical methods focus on two- and three-dimensional data and common task such as finding outliers and tail structure, assessing central structure and comparing central structures. The methods handle large sample size problems through binning, incorporate information from statistical models and adapt image processing algorithms. Examples demonstrate the application of methods to a variety of publicly available large data sets. The most novel application addresses the too many plots to examine problem by using cognostics, computer guiding diagnostics, to prioritize plots. The particular application prioritizes views of computational fluid dynamics solution sets on the fly. That is, as each time step of a solution set is generated on a parallel processor the cognostics algorithms assess virtual plots based on the previous time step.

The phrase hexagon mosaic map refers to maps that use hexagons to tessellate major areas of a map, such as land masses. Hexagon mosaic maps are similar to color-contour (isarithm) maps and show broad regional patterns. The ray glyph, an oriented line segment with a dot at the base, provides a convenient symbol for representing information within a hexagon cell. Ray angle encodes the local estimate for the hexagon. A simple extension adds upper- and lower-confidence bounds as a shaded arc bounded by two rays. Another extension, the bivariate ray glyph, provides a continuous representation for showing the local correlation of two variables. The theme of integrating statistical analysis and cartographic methods appears throughout this paper. Example maps show statistical summaries of acidic deposition data for the eastern United States. These maps provide useful templates for a wide range of statisti...",

How and to what extent will the information on social media achieve widespread diffusion across the world? How can we quantify the interaction between users from different geolocations in the diffusion process? How will the spatial patterns of information diffusion change over time? To address these questions, a dynamic social gravity model (SGM) is proposed to quantify the dynamic spatial interaction behavior among social media users in information diffusion. The dynamic SGM includes three factors that are theoretically significant to the spatial diffusion of information: geographic distance, cultural proximity, and linguistic similarity. Temporal dimension is also taken into account to help detect recency effect, and ground-truth data is integrated into the model to help measure the diffusion power. Furthermore, SocialWave, a visual analytic system, is developed to support both spatial and temporal investigative tasks. SocialWave provides a temporal visualization that allows users to quickly identify the overall temporal diffusion patterns, which reflect the spatial characteristics of the diffusion network. When a meaningful temporal pattern is identified, SocialWave utilizes a new occlusion-free spatial visualization, which integrates a node-link diagram into a circular cartogram for further analysis. Moreover, we propose a set of rich user interactions that enable in-depth, multi-faceted analysis of the diffusion on social media. The effectiveness and efficiency of the mathematical model and visualization system are evaluated with two datasets on social media, namely, Ebola Epidemics and Ferguson Unrest.",

In this paper, we perform an in-depth benchmarking study of IM techniques on social networks. Specifically, we design a benchmarking platform, which enables us to evaluate and compare the existing techniques systematically and thoroughly under identical experimental conditions. Our benchmarking results analyze and diagnose the inherent deficiencies of the existing approaches and surface the open challenges in IM even after a decade of research.

This approach makes sense when it is supported by a visual analytics framework dedicated to graph rewriting.

In this paper, we introduce a visual analysis system called OpinionFlow to empower analysts to detect opinion propagation patterns and glean insights. Inspired by the information diffusion model and the theory of selective exposure, we develop an opinion diffusion model to approximate opinion propagation among Twitter users. Accordingly, we design an opinion flow visualization that combines a Sankey graph with a tailored density map in one view to visually convey diffusion of opinions among many users. A stacked tree is used to allow analysts to select topics of interest at different levels. The stacked tree is synchronized with the opinion flow visualization to help users examine and compare diffusion patterns across topics.

Everyday, millions of messages are created, commented, and shared by people on social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. This provides valuable data for researchers and practitioners in many application domains, such as marketing, to inform decision-making. Distilling valuable social signals from the huge crowds messages, however, is challenging, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic crowd behaviors. The challenge is rooted in data analysts capability of discerning the anomalous information behaviors, such as the spreading of rumors or misinformation, from the rest that are more conventional patterns, such as popular topics and newsworthy events, in a timely fashion. FluxFlow incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, and offers a set of novel visualization designs for presenting the detected threads for deeper analysis. We evaluated FluxFlow with real datasets containing the Twitter feeds captured during significant events such as Hurricane Sandy. Through quantitative measurements of the algorithmic performance and qualitative interviews with domain experts, the results show that the back-end anomaly detection model is effective in identifying anomalous retweeting threads, and its front-end interactive visualizations are intuitive and useful for analysts to discover insights in data and comprehend the underlying analytical model.",

Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behaviour through their individual actions. However, considering the extended literature surrounding the subject, one is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, or consider slight variations of a model. This requires having a common language describing all considered models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. This also assumes users can easily run models, steer them and interactively evaluate their performance and behaviour. The approach we describe aims at providing a framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic transformation rules acting locally. Our approach has partially been validated by providing such a description of a well-known model relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbors influences. The results so obtained confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. The use of a visual analytics framework to conduct such tasks is vital and motivated us to further develop and adapt a general purpose visual analytics system for graph rewriting to the particular case of network propagation.",

Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g. circles on Google+, and lists on Facebook and Twitter), however they are laborious to construct and must be updated whenever a users network grows. We define a novel machine learning task of identifying users social circles. We pose the problem as a node clustering problem on a users ego-network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information. For each circle we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles.

Social media, like Twitter, has been increasingly used for exchanging information, opinions and emotions about events that are happening across the world. Here we propose a novel visualization design, Whisper, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters. Initial feedback from domain experts suggests promising use for todays information consumption and dispersion in the wild.",

A novel streaming algorithm automatically discovers these peaks and labels them meaningfully using text from the tweets. Users can drill down to subevents, and explore further via geolocation, sentiment, and popular URLs. We contribute a recall-normalized aggregate sentiment visualization to produce more honest sentiment overviews. An evaluation of the system revealed that users were able to reconstruct meaningful summaries of events in a small amount of time. An interview with a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist suggested that the system would be especially useful for understanding a long-running event and for identifying eyewitnesses.

The scalability of influence maximization is a key factor for enabling prevalent viral marketing in large-scale online social networks. Prior solutions, such as the greedy algorithm of Kempe et al. (2003) and its improvements are slow and not scalable, while other heuristic algorithms do not provide consistently good performance on influence spreads. In this paper, we design a new heuristic algorithm that is easily scalable to millions of nodes and edges in our experiments. Our algorithm has a simple tunable parameter for users to control the balance between the running time and the influence spread of the algorithm. Our results from extensive simulations on several real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that our algorithm is currently the best scalable solution to the influence maximization problem: (a) our algorithm scales beyond million-sized graphs where the greedy algorithm becomes infeasible, and (b) in all size ranges, our algorithm performs consistently well in influence spread --- it is always among the best algorithms, and in most cases it significantly outperforms all other scalable heuristics to as much as 100%--260% increase in influence spread.",

In this paper, we study the efficient influence maximization from two complementary directions. One is to improve the original greedy algorithm of [5] and its improvement [7] to further reduce its running time, and the second is to propose new degree discount heuristics that improves influence spread. We evaluate our algorithms by experiments on two large academic collaboration graphs obtained from the online archival database arXiv.org. Our experimental results show that (a) our improved greedy algorithm achieves better running time comparing with the improvement of [7] with matching influence spread, (b) our degree discount heuristics achieve much better influence spread than classic degree and centrality-based heuristics, and when tuned for a specific influence cascade model, it achieves almost matching influence thread with the greedy algorithm, and more importantly (c) the degree discount heuristics run only in milliseconds while even the improved greedy algorithms run in hours in our experiment graphs with a few tens of thousands of nodes. Based on our results, we believe that fine-tuned heuristics may provide truly scalable solutions to the influence maximization problem with satisfying influence spread and blazingly fast running time. Therefore, contrary to what implied by the conclusion of [5] that traditional heuristics are outperformed by the greedy approximation algorithm, our results shed new lights on the research of heuristic algorithms.",

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.",

This double structural nature makes it difficult to adopt a homogeneous visualization model that clearly conveys both an overview of the network and the internal structure of its communities at the same time. As a consequence, the use of hybrid visualizations has been proposed. For instance, NodeTrix combines node-link and matrix-based representations (Henry et al., 2007). In this article we describe ChordLink, a hybrid visualization model that embeds chord diagrams, used to represent dense subgraphs, into a node-link diagram, which shows the global network structure. The visualization makes it possible to interactively highlight the structure of a community while keeping the rest of the layout stable. We discuss the intriguing algorithmic challenges behind the ChordLink model, present a prototype system that implements it, and illustrate case studies on real-world networks.",

It was not until January 23rd that the Wuhan government finally recognized the severity of the epidemic and took a drastic measure to curtain the virus spread by closing down all transportation connecting the outside world. In this study, we seek to answer a few questions: How did the virus get spread from the epicenter Wuhan city to the rest of the country? To what extent did the measures, such as, city closure and community quarantine, help controlling the situation? More importantly, can we forecast any significant future development of the event had some of the conditions changed?

The value equation contains components for the time savings a visualization provides, the insights and insightful questions it spurs, the overall essence of the data it conveys, and the confidence about the data and its domain it inspires. This articulation of value is purely descriptive, however, providing no actionable method of assessing a visualizations value. In this work, we create a heuristic-based evaluation methodology to accompany the value equation for assessing interactive visualizations. We refer to the methodology colloquially as ICE-T, based on an anagram of the four value components. Our approach breaks the four components down into guidelines, each of which is made up of a small set of low-level heuristics. Evaluators who have knowledge of visualization design principles then assess the visualization with respect to the heuristics. We conducted an initial trial of the methodology on three interactive visualizations of the same data set, each evaluated by 15 visualization experts. We found that the methodology showed promise, obtaining consistent ratings across the three visualizations and mirroring judgments of the utility of the visualizations by instructors of the course in which they were developed.",

A number of algorithms for graph visualization have been developed over the past decades. The issue on how to design and develop algorithms by taking into account the characteristics of real graphs such as scale-free and hierarchical structures, however, has not been well addressed. In this paper, we extend the concept of a node degree to a node global degree for a node in a graph, and present an algorithm that computes their scores of all nodes. By taking advantage of the common structure features of real networks, two scalable extensions of this algorithm are further provided that are able to approximate computation results. Based on node global degrees, a filtering approach is presented to reduce the visual complexity of a layout. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of two common evaluation metrics, as well as visualization results. In addition, we have implemented the algorithms in a prototype system, which enable users to explore a graph at continuous levels of details in real time, as evidenced by several real examples.",

However, untrustworthy users give fraudulent ratings for excessive monetary gains. In this paper, we present REV2, a system to identify such fraudulent users. We propose three interdependent intrinsic quality metrics---fairness of a user, reliability of a rating and goodness of a product. The fairness and reliability quantify the trustworthiness of a user and rating, respectively, and goodness quantifies the quality of a product. Intuitively, a user is fair if it provides reliable scores that are close to the goodness of products. We propose six axioms to establish the interdependency between the scores, and then, formulate a mutually recursive definition that satisfies these axioms. We extend the formulation to address cold start problem and incorporate behavior properties. We develop the REV2 algorithm to calculate these intrinsic quality scores for all users, ratings, and products. We show that this algorithm is guaranteed to converge and has linear time complexity. By conducting extensive experiments on five rating datasets, we show that REV2 outperforms nine existing algorithms in detecting fair and unfair users. We reported the 150 most unfair users in the Flipkart network to their review fraud investigators, and 127 users were identified as being fraudulent(84.6% accuracy).

WSNs can capture like/dislike, trust/distrust, and other social relationships between people. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting the weights of edges in such networks. We propose two novel measures of node behavior: the goodness of a node intuitively captures how much this node is liked/trusted by other nodes, while the fairness of a node captures how fair the node is in rating other nodes likeability or trust level. We provide axioms that these two notions need to satisfy and show that past work does not meet these requirements for WSNs. We provide a mutually recursive definition of these two concepts and prove that they converge to a unique solution in linear time. We use the two measures to predict the edge weight in WSNs. Furthermore, we show that when compared against several individual algorithms from both the signed and unsigned social network literature, our fairness and goodness metrics almost always have the best predictive power. We then use these as features in different multiple regression models and show that we can predict edge weights on 2 Bitcoin WSNs, an Epinions WSN, 2 WSNs derived from Wikipedia, and a WSN derived from Twitter with more accurate results than past work. Moreover, fairness and goodness metrics form the most significant feature for prediction in most (but not all) cases.",

Due to its high input dimensionality, time requirements, and resource constraints, simulating over the entire parameter space is unfeasible. One solution is to take a granular sampling of the input space and use simpler predictive models (emulators) in between. The quality of the implemented emulator depends on many factors: robustness, sophistication, configuration, and suitability to the input data. Visual analytics can be leveraged to provide guidance and understanding of these things to the user. In this paper, we have implemented a novel interface and workflow for emulator building and use. We introduce a workflow to build emulators, make predictions, and then analyze the results. Our prediction process first predicts temporal time series, and uses these to derive predicted spatial densities. Integrated into the EpiSimS framework, we target users who are non-experts at statistical modeling. This approach allows for a high level of analysis into the state of the built emulators and their resultant predictions. We present our workflow, models, the associated system, and evaluate the overall utility with feedback from EpiSimS scientists.",

In this paper we argue that many of the advantages of specialized graph processing systems can be recovered in a modern general-purpose distributed dataflow system. We introduce GraphX, an embedded graph processing framework built on top of Apache Spark, a widely used distributed dataflow system. GraphX presents a familiar composable graph abstraction that is sufficient to express existing graph APIs, yet can be implemented using only a few basic dataflow operators (e.g., join, map, group-by). To achieve performance parity with specialized graph systems, GraphX recasts graph-specific optimizations as distributed join optimizations and materialized view maintenance. By leveraging advances in distributed dataflow frameworks, GraphX brings low-cost fault tolerance to graph processing. We evaluate GraphX on real workloads and demonstrate that GraphX achieves an order of magnitude performance gain over the base dataflow framework and matches the performance of specialized graph processing systems while enabling a wider range of computation.",

Based on an in-depth literature review and interviews with neuroscientists, we explore high-level brain connectivity analysis tasks that need to be supported by dedicated visual analysis tools. A significant example of such a task is the comparison of different connectivity data in the form of weighted graphs. Several approaches have been suggested for graph comparison within information visualization, but the comparison of weighted graphs has not been addressed. We explored the design space of applicable visual representations and present augmented adjacency matrix and node-link visualizations. To assess which representation best support weighted graph comparison tasks, we performed a controlled experiment. Our findings suggest that matrices support these tasks well, outperforming node-link diagrams. These results have significant implications for the design of brain connectivity analysis tools that require weighted graph comparisons.

As a first step in developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related to comparison. Although we find a great diversity of systems and approaches, we see that all designs are assembled from the building blocks of juxtaposition, superposition and explicit encodings.

Linked views and interactive displays provide insight into correlations among people, events, and places in space and time. Analysts search for events of interest through statistical tools linked to visual displays, drill down into the data, and form hypotheses based upon the available information. However, current systems stop short of predicting events. In spatiotemporal data, analysts are searching for regions of space and time with unusually high incidences of events (hotspots). In the cases where hotspots are found, analysts would like to predict how these regions may grow in order to plan resource allocation and preventative measures. Furthermore, analysts would also like to predict where future hotspots may occur. To facilitate such forecasting, we have created a predictive visual analytics toolkit that provides analysts with linked spatiotemporal and statistical analytic views. Our system models spatiotemporal events through the combination of kernel density estimation for event distribution and seasonal trend decomposition by loess smoothing for temporal predictions. We provide analysts with estimates of error in our modeling, along with spatial and temporal alerts to indicate the occurrence of statistically significant hotspots. Spatial data are distributed based on a modeling of previous event locations, thereby maintaining a temporal coherence with past events. Such tools allow analysts to perform real-time hypothesis testing, plan intervention strategies, and allocate resources to correspond to perceived threats.",

In this paper, we propose a new clustering technique whose goal is that of producing both intracluster graphs and intercluster graph with desired topological properties. We formalize this concept in the (X,Y) -clustering framework, where Y is the class that defines the desired topological properties of intracluster graphs and X is the class that defines the desired topological properties of the intercluster graph. By exploiting this approach, hybrid visualization tools can effectively combine different node-link and matrix-based representations, allowing users to interactively explore the graph by expansion/contraction of clusters without loosing their mental map. As a proof of concept, we describe the system Visual Hybrid (X,Y)-clustering (VHYXY) that implements our approach and we present the results of case studies to the visual analysis of social networks.",

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.",

This approach often leads to actors belonging to one and only one cluster, whereas in real life a person can belong to several communities. As a solution we propose duplicating actors in social networks and discuss potential impact of such a move. Several visual duplication designs are discussed and a controlled experiment comparing network visualization with and without duplication is performed, using 6 tasks that are important for graph readability and visual interpretation of social networks. We show that in our experiment, duplications significantly improve community-related tasks but sometimes interfere with other graph readability tasks. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for deciding when to duplicate actors and choosing candidates for duplication, and alternative ways to render them in social network representations.",

This simplification approach deterministically filters (instead of clustering) the graph to retain important node and edge semantics, and works both automatically and interactively. The improved graph filtering and layout is combined with a novel computer graphics anisotropic shading of the dense crisscrossing array of edges to yield a full social network and scale-free graph visualization system.

Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.",

The research proposes a general visual analytic approach to synthesize very large spatial interaction data and discover interesting (and unknown) patterns. The proposed approach involves a suite of visual and computational techniques, including (1) a new graph partitioning method to segment a very large interaction graph into a moderate number of spatially contiguous subgraphs (regions); (2) a reorderable matrix, with regions optimally ordered on the diagonal, to effectively present a holistic view of major spatial interaction patterns; and (3) a modified flow map, interactively linked to the reorderable matrix, to enable pattern interpretation in a geographical context. The implemented system is able to visualize both peoples daily movements and a disease spread over space in a similar way.

If the expected profit from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected profit from sales to her). We propose to model also the customers network value: the expected profit from sales to other customers she may influence to buy, the customers those may influence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative filtering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers---also known as viral marketing---can be extremely effective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.",

Upon a user query, the accurate result on the current graph can be quickly computed by feeding the approximate results to the iterative computation --- a form of incremental computation that corrects the (small amount of) error in the approximate result. Despite the effectiveness of this approach in processing growing graphs, it is generally not applicable when edge deletions are present --- existing approximations can lead to either incorrect results (e.g., monotonic computations terminate at an incorrect minima/maxima) or poor performance (e.g., with approximations, convergence takes longer than performing the computation from scratch). This paper presents KickStarter, a runtime technique that can trim the approximate values for a subset of vertices impacted by the deleted edges. The trimmed approximation is both safe and profitable, enabling the computation to produce correct results and converge quickly. KickStarter works for a class of monotonic graph algorithms and can be readily incorporated in any existing streaming graph system. Our experiments with four streaming algorithms on five large graphs demonstrate that trimming not only produces correct results but also accelerates these algorithms by 8.5--23.7x.",

We introduce Matrix Diagnostics (or Magnostics), following in spirit related approaches for rating and ranking other visualization techniques, such as Scagnostics for scatter plots. Our approach ranks matrix views according to the appearance of specific visual patterns, such as blocks and lines, indicating the existence of topological motifs in the data, such as clusters, bi-graphs, or central nodes. Magnostics can be used to analyze, query, or search for visually similar matrices in large collections, or to assess the quality of matrix reordering algorithms. While many feature descriptors for image analyzes exist, there is no evidence how they perform for detecting patterns in matrices. In order to make an informed choice of feature descriptors for matrix diagnostics, we evaluate 30 feature descriptors-27 existing ones and three new descriptors that we designed specifically for MAGNOSTICS-with respect to four criteria: pattern response, pattern variability, pattern sensibility, and pattern discrimination. We conclude with an informed set of six descriptors as most appropriate for Magnostics and demonstrate their application in two scenarios; exploring a large collection of matrices and analyzing temporal networks.",

An important task when making sense of such data is to provide users with an overview to identify items that show an interesting development over time, including both absolute and relative changes in multiple attributes simultaneously. However, this is not well supported by existing visualization techniques. To address this issue, we present ThermalPlot, a visualization technique that summarizes combinations of multiple attributes over time using an items position, the most salient visual variable. More precisely, the x-position in the  ThermalPlot is based on a user-defined degree-of-interest (DoI) function that combines multiple attributes over time. The y-position is determined by the relative change in the DoI value ( Delta DoI) within a user-specified time window. Animating this mapping via a moving time window gives rise to circular movements of items over timeas in thermal systems. To help the user to identify important items that match user-defined temporal patterns and to increase the techniques scalability, we adapt the level of detail of the items representation based on the DoI value. Furthermore, we present an interactive exploration environment for multi-attribute time-series data that ties together a carefully chosen set of visualizations, designed to support analysts in interacting with the ThermalPlot technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by means of two usage scenarios that address the visual analysis of economic development data and of stock market data.",

Debugging the massive parallel computations that run in todays data-centers is time consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, we design a set of interactive, real-time debugging primitives for big data processing in Apache Spark, the next generation data-intensive scalable cloud computing platform. This requires re-thinking the notion of step-through debugging in a traditional debugger such as gdb, because pausing the entire computation across distributed worker nodes causes significant delay and naively inspecting millions of records using a watchpoint is too time consuming for an end user.First, BigDebugs simulated breakpoints and on-demand watchpoints allow users to selectively examine distributed, intermediate data on the cloud with little overhead. Second, a user can also pinpoint a crash-inducing record and selectively resume relevant sub-computations after a quick fix. Third, a user can determine the root causes of errors (or delays) at the level of individual records through a fine-grained data provenance capability. Our evaluation shows that BigDebug scales to terabytes and its record-level tracing incurs less than 25% overhead on average. It determines crash culprits orders of magnitude more accurately and provides up to 100% time saving compared to the baseline replay debugger. The results show that BigDebug supports debugging at interactive speeds with minimal performance impact.",

Even for visual representation, there has been limited study of the impact on users of visual encodings and the strengths and weaknesses of Cartesian and Polar coordinate systems. In order to address this research gap, we performed a comprehensive graphical perception study that measured the effectiveness of time series visualisations with different interactions, visual encodings and coordinate systems for several tasks.

Earlier systems that process graphs from secondary storage are restricted to a single machine, and therefore limited by the bandwidth and capacity of the storage system on a single machine. Chaos is limited only by the aggregate bandwidth and capacity of all storage devices in the entire cluster. Chaos builds on the streaming partitions introduced by X-Stream in order to achieve sequential access to storage, but parallelizes the execution of streaming partitions. Chaos is novel in three ways. First, Chaos partitions for sequential storage access, rather than for locality and load balance, resulting in much lower pre-processing times. Second, Chaos distributes graph data uniformly randomly across the cluster and does not attempt to achieve locality, based on the observation that in a small cluster network bandwidth far outstrips storage bandwidth. Third, Chaos uses work stealing to allow multiple machines to work on a single partition, thereby achieving load balance at runtime. In terms of performance scaling, on 32 machines Chaos takes on average only 1.61 times longer to process a graph 32 times larger than on a single machine. In terms of capacity scaling, Chaos is capable of handling a graph with 1 trillion edges representing 16 TB of input data, a new milestone for graph processing capacity on a small commodity cluster.",

While numerous graph processing systems have been developed and evaluated on available benchmark graphs of up to 6.6B edges, they often face significant difficulties in scaling to much larger graphs. Industry graphs can be two orders of magnitude larger - hundreds of billions or up to one trillion edges. In addition to scalability challenges, real world applications often require much more complex graph processing workflows than previously evaluated. In this paper, we describe the usability, performance, and scalability improvements we made to Apache Giraph, an open-source graph processing system, in order to use it on Facebook-scale graphs of up to one trillion edges. We also describe several key extensions to the original Pregel model that make it possible to develop a broader range of production graph applications and workflows as well as improve code reuse.

Billion-node graphs that exceed the memory capacity of commodity machines are not well supported by popular Big Data tools like MapReduce, which are notoriously poor performing for iterative graph algorithms such as PageRank. In response, a new type of framework challenges one to think like a vertex (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an approach improves locality, demonstrates linear scalability, and provides a natural way to express and compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks are simple to program and widely applicable but, like an operating system, are composed of several intricate, interdependent components, of which a thorough understanding is necessary in order to elicit top performance at scale. To this end, the first comprehensive survey of TLAV frameworks is presented. In this survey, the vertex-centric approach to graph processing is overviewed, TLAV frameworks are deconstructed into four main components and respectively analyzed, and TLAV implementations are reviewed and categorized.",

In these networks, relationships among components can be of arbitrary cardinality (1:1, 1:n, n:m), making it challenging for administrators to investigate which components influence others. In this paper we present CloudGazer, a scalable visualization system that allows users to monitor and optimize cloud-based networks effectively to reduce energy consumption and to increase the quality of service. Instead of visualizing the overall network, we split the graph into semantic perspectives that provide a much simpler view of the network. CloudGazer is a multiple coordinated view system that visualizes either static or live status information about the components of a perspective while reintroducing lost inter-perspective relationships on demand using dynamically created inlays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CloudGazer in two usage scenarios: The first is based on a real-world network of our domain partners where static performance parameters are used to find an optimal design. In the second scenario we use the VAST 2013 Challenge dataset to demonstrate how the system can be employed with live streaming data.",

To efficiently analyze such large graphs, many distributed graph computing systems have been developed. These systems employ the think like a vertex programming paradigm, where a program proceeds in iterations and at each iteration, vertices exchange messages with each other. However, using Pregels simple message passing mechanism, some vertices may send/receive significantly more messages than others due to either the high degree of these vertices or the logic of the algorithm used. This forms the communication bottleneck and leads to imbalanced workload among machines in the cluster. In this paper, we propose two effective message reduction techniques: (1)vertex mirroring with message combining, and (2)an additional request-respond API. These techniques not only reduce the total number of messages exchanged through the network, but also bound the number of messages sent/received by any single vertex. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of our techniques, and implement them on top of our open-source Pregel implementation called Pregel+. Our experiments on various large real graphs demonstrate that our message reduction techniques significantly improve the performance of distributed graph computation.",

We observe that on distributed shared memory systems, by converting synchronous algorithms into their asynchronous counterparts, algorithms can be made tolerant to high inter-node communication latency. However, high inter-node communication latency can lead to excessive use of stale values causing an increase in the number of iterations required by the algorithms to converge. Although by using bounded staleness we can restrict the slowdown in the rate of convergence, this also restricts the ability to tolerate communication latency. In this paper we design a relaxed memory consistency model and consistency protocol that simultaneously tolerate communication latency and minimize the use of stale values. This is achieved via a coordinated use of best effort refresh policy and bounded staleness. We demonstrate that for a range of asynchronous graph algorithms and PDE solvers, on an average, our approach outperforms algorithms based upon: prior relaxed memory models that allow stale values by at least 2.27x; and Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model by 4.2x. We also show that our approach frequently outperforms GraphLab, a popular distributed graph processing framework.",

                  "abstract": "In the last years, large-scale graph processing has gained increasing attention, with most recent systems placing particular emphasis on latency. One possible technique to improve runtime performance in a distributed graph processing system is to reduce network communication. The most notable way to achieve this goal is to partition the graph by minimizing the number of edges that connect vertices assigned to different machines, while keeping the load balanced. However, real-world graphs are highly dynamic, with vertices and edges being constantly added and removed. Carefully updating the partitioning of the graph to reflect these changes is necessary to avoid the introduction of an extensive number of cut edges, which would gradually worsen computation performance. In this paper we show that performance degradation in dynamic graph processing systems can be avoided by adapting continuously the graph partitions as the graph changes. We present a novel highly scalable adaptive partitioning strategy, and show a number of refinements that make it work under the constraints of a large-scale distributed system. The partitioning strategy is based on iterative vertex migrations, relying only on local information. We have implemented the technique in a graph processing system, and we show through three real-world scenarios how adapting graph partitioning reduces execution time by over 50% when compared to commonly used hash-partitioning.",

Common among these is that the space can become very large, e.g., temperature measurements could span a long time period, surveillance video could cover entire days or weeks, and documents can have thousands of pages. Many analysis tasks for such spaces require several foci while retaining context and distance awareness. In this extended version of our IEEE PacificVis 2010 paper, we introduce a method for supporting this kind of multifocus interaction that we call stack zooming. The approach is based on building hierarchies of 1D strips stacked on top of each other, where each subsequent stack represents a higher zoom level, and sibling strips represent branches in the exploration. Correlation graphics show the relation between stacks and strips of different levels, providing context and distance awareness for the foci. The zoom hierarchies can also be used as graphical histories and for communicating insights to stakeholders and can be further extended with annotation and integrated statistics.",

The algorithm tries to determine optimal location and orientation of individual clusters intrinsically within a modified spring embedder. Heuristics such as reversal of the order of nodes in a cluster and swap of neighboring node pairs in the same cluster are employed intermittently to further relax the spring embedder system, resulting in reduced inter-cluster edge crossings. Unlike other algorithms generating circular drawings, our algorithm does not require the quotient graph to be acyclic, nor does it sacrifice the edge crossing number of individual clusters to improve respective positioning of the clusters. Moreover, it reduces the total area required by a cluster by using the space inside the associated circle. Experimental results show that the execution time and quality of the produced drawings with respect to commonly accepted layout criteria are quite satisfactory, surpassing previous algorithms. The algorithm has also been successfully implemented and made publicly available as part of a compound and clustered graph editing and layout tool named Chisio.",

Analyzing many time series at once is a common yet difficult task in many domains, for example in network monitoring. Several visualization techniques have, thus, been proposed in the literature. Among these, iconic displays or glyphs are an appropriate choice because of their expressiveness and effective use of screen space. Through a controlled experiment, we compare the performance of four glyphs that use different combinations of visual variables to encode two properties of temporal data: a) the position of a data point in time and b) the quantitative value of this data point. Our results show that depending on tasks and data density, the chosen glyphs performed differently. Line Glyphs are generally a good choice for peak and trend detection tasks but radial encodings are more effective for reading values at specific temporal locations. From our qualitative analysis we also contribute implications for designing temporal glyphs for small multiple settings.",

                  "abstract": "Scaling large iterative graph processing applications through parallel computing is a very important problem. Several graph processing frameworks have been proposed that insulate developers from low-level details of parallel programming. Most of these frameworks are based on the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model in order to simplify application development. However, in the BSP model, vertices are processed in fixed rounds, which often leads to slow convergence. Asynchronous executions can significantly accelerate convergence by intelligently ordering vertex updates and incorporating the most recent updates. Unfortunately, asynchronous models do not provide the programming simplicity and scalability advantages of the BSP model. In this paper, we combine the easy programmability of the BSP model with the high performance of asynchronous execution. We have designed GRACE, a new graph programming platform that separates application logic from execution policies. GRACE provides a synchronous iterative graph programming model for users to easily implement, test, and debug their applications. It also contains a carefully designed and implemented parallel execution engine for both synchronous and user-specified built-in asynchronous execution policies. Our experiments show that asynchronous execution in GRACE can yield convergence rates comparable to fully asynchronous executions, while still achieving the near-linear scalability of a synchronous BSP system.",

In this paper, we characterize the challenges of computation on natural graphs in the context of existing graph-parallel abstractions. We then introduce the PowerGraph abstraction which exploits the internal structure of graph programs to address these challenges. Leveraging the PowerGraph abstraction we introduce a new approach to distributed graph placement and representation that exploits the structure of power-law graphs. We provide a detailed analysis and experimental evaluation comparing PowerGraph to two popular graph-parallel systems. Finally, we describe three different implementation strategies for PowerGraph and discuss their relative merits with empirical evaluations on large-scale real-world problems demonstrating order of magnitude gains.",

We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development.

Modern data visualization problems in the domains of news analysis, network security and financial applications, require visual analysis of incremental data, which poses specific challenges that are normally not solved by static visualizations. The incremental nature of the data implies that visualizations have to necessarily change their content and still provide comprehensible representations. In particular, in this paper we deal with the need to keep an eye on recent events together with providing a context on the past and to make relevant patterns accessible at any scale. Our technique adapts to the incoming data by taking care of the rate at which data items occur and by using a decay function to let the items fade away according to their relevance. Since access to details is also important, we also provide a novel distortion magnifying lens technique which takes into account the distortions introduced by the logarithmic time scale to augment readability in selected areas of interest. We demonstrate the validity of our techniques by applying them on incremental data coming from online news streams in different time frames.",

There has been comparatively little research on how to support the more elaborate tasks associated with the exploratory visual analysis of timeseries, e.g., visualizing derived values, identifying correlations, or discovering anomalies beyond obvious outliers. Such tasks typically require deriving new time-series from the original data, trying different functions and parameters in an iterative manner.

We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs).

Our tool is effective in displaying variation in genome structure and, generally, any other kind of positional relationships between genomic intervals. Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text.

Several components work together in the ZAME tool to make this possible. Efficient matrix ordering algorithms group related elements. Individual data cases are aggregated into higher-order meta-representations. Aggregates are arranged into a pyramid hierarchy that allows for on-demand paging to GPU shader programs to support smooth multiscale browsing.

We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations",

The goal of this research is to develop techniques for visualizing details as precisely as possible in overview display. In this paper, visualization of a one-dimensional but very large dataset is considered. The proposed method is based on pseudo coloring, however, each scalar value corresponds to two discrete colors. By painting with two colors at each value, users can read out the value precisely. This method has many advantages: it requires little image space for visualization; both the overview and details of the dataset are visible in one image without distortion; and implementation is very simple. Several application examples, such as meteorological observation data and train convenience evaluation data, show the effectiveness of the method.",

Incorporating similar experimental stimuli and tasks, we conducted an experiment where 96 crowdworker participants performed nine trend comparison tasks using their mobile phones. We found that those using a small multiples design consistently completed tasks in less time, albeit with slightly less confidence than those using an animated design. The accuracy results were more task-dependent, and we further interpret our results according to the characteristics of the individual tasks, with a specific focus on the trajectories of target and distractor data items in each task. We identify cases that appear to favor either animation or small multiples, providing new questions for further experimental research and implications for visualization design on mobile devices.

                  "abstract": "There is no complete solution for the problem of abuse of statistics, but methodological training needs to cover cognitive biases and other psychosocial factors affecting inferences. The present paper discusses 3 common cognitive distortions: 1) dichotomania, the compulsion to perceive quantities as dichotomous even when dichotomization is unnecessary and misleading, as in inferences based on whether a P value is statistically significant; 2) nullism, the tendency to privilege the hypothesis of no difference or no effect when there is no scientific basis for doing so, as when testing only the null hypothesis; and 3) statistical reification, treating hypothetical data distributions and statistical models as if they reflect known physical laws rather than speculative assumptions for thought experiments. As commonly misused, null-hypothesis significance testing combines these cognitive problems to produce highly distorted interpretation and reporting of study results. Interval estimation has so far proven to be an inadequate solution because it involves dichotomization, an avenue for nullism. Sensitivity and bias analyses have been proposed to address reproducibility problems (Am J Epidemiol. 2017;186(6):646-647); these methods can indeed address reification, but they can also introduce new distortions via misleading specifications for bias parameters. P values can be reframed to lessen distortions by presenting them without reference to a cutoff, providing them for relevant alternatives to the null, and recognizing their dependence on all assumptions used in their computation; they nonetheless require rescaling for measuring evidence. I conclude that methodological development and training should go beyond coverage of mechanistic biases (e.g., confounding, selection bias, measurement error) to cover distortions of conclusions produced by statistical methods and psychosocial forces.",

We assess in a controlled experiment the impact of selection technique on a shortest path identification task. Pairs consistently divided space even if the task is not spatially divisible, and for the basic selection technique that has a localized visual effect, it led to parallel work that negatively impacted accuracy.

Pictures and communication about non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) can frequently be found on the internet. Methods During 4 weeks in April 2016, n = 2826 (from n = 1154 accounts) pictures which directly depicted wounds on Instagram were investigated. Those pictures, associated comments, and user accounts were independently rated for content. Associations between characteristics of pictures and comments as well as weekly and daily trends of posting behavior were analyzed. Results Most commonly, pictures depicted wounds caused by cutting on arms or legs and were rated as mild or moderate injuries. Pictures with increasing wound grades and those depicting multiple methods of NSSI generated elevated amounts of comments. While most comments were neutral or empathic with some offering help, few comments were hostile. Pictures were mainly posted in the evening hours, with a small peak in the early morning. While there was a slight peak of pictures being posted on Sundays, postings were rather evenly spread across the week. Conclusions Pictures of NSSI are frequently posted on Instagram. Social reinforcement might play a role in the posting of more severe NSSI pictures. Social media platforms need to take appropriate measures for preventing online social contagion.",

                  "abstract": "Cobbs concern was a long-worrisome circularity in the sociology of science based on the use of bright lines such as p< 0.05: We teach it because its what we do; we do it because its what we teach. This concern was brought to the attention of the ASA Board. The ASA Board was also stimulated by highly visible discussions over the last few years. For example, ScienceNews (Siegfried 2010) wrote: Its sciences dirtiest secret: The scientific method of testing hypotheses by statistical analysis stands on a flimsy foundation. A November 2013, article in Phys.org Science News Wire (2013) cited numerous deep flaws in null hypothesis significance testing. A ScienceNews article (Siegfried 2014) on February 7, 2014, said statistical techniques for testing hypotheses...havemore flaws than Facebooks privacy policies. Aweek later, statistician and Simply Statistics blogger Jeff Leek responded. The problem is not that people use P-values poorly, Leek wrote, it is that the vast majority of data analysis is not performed by people properly trained to perform data analysis (Leek 2014). That same week, statistician and science writer Regina Nuzzo published an article in Nature entitled Scientific Method: Statistical Errors (Nuzzo 2014). That article is nowone of the most highly viewedNature articles, as reported by altmetric.com (http://www.altmetric.com/details/2115792#score). Of course, it was not simply a matter of responding to some articles in print. The statistical community has been deeply concerned about issues of reproducibility and replicability of scientific conclusions. Without getting into definitions and distinctions of these terms, we observe that much confusion and even doubt about the validity of science is arising. Such doubt can lead to radical choices, such as the one taken by the editors of Basic andApplied Social Psychology, who decided to ban p-values (null hypothesis significance testing) (Trafimow and Marks 2015). Misunderstanding or misuse of statistical inference is only one cause of the reproducibility crisis (Peng 2015), but to our community, it is an important one. When the ASA Board decided to take up the challenge of developing a policy statement on p-values and statistical significance, it did so recognizing this was not a lightly taken step. The ASA has not previously taken positions on specific matters of statistical practice. The closest the association has come to this is a statement on the use of value-added models (VAM) for educational assessment (Morganstein and Wasserstein 2014) and a statement on risk-limiting post-election audits (American Statistical Association 2010). However, these were truly policy-related statements. The VAM statement addressed a key educational policy issue, acknowledging the complexity of the issues involved, citing limitations of VAMs as effective performance models, and urging that they be developed and interpreted with the involvement of statisticians. The statement on election auditing was also in response to a major but specific policy issue (close elections in 2008), and said that statistically based election audits should become a routine part of election processes. By contrast, the Board envisioned that the ASA statement on p-values and statistical significance would shed light on an aspect of our field that is too often misunderstood and misused in the broader research community, and, in the process, provides the community a service. The intended audience would be researchers, practitioners, and science writers who are not primarily statisticians. Thus, this statementwould be quite different from anything previously attempted. The Board tasked Wasserstein with assembling a group of experts representing a wide variety of points of view. On behalf of the Board, he reached out to more than two dozen such people, all of whom said theywould be happy to be involved. Several expressed doubt about whether agreement could be reached, but those who did said, in effect, that if there was going to be a discussion, they wanted to be involved. Over the course of many months, group members discussed what format the statement should take, tried to more concretely visualize the audience for the statement, and began to find points of agreement. That turned out to be relatively easy to do, but it was just as easy to find points of intense disagreement. The time came for the group to sit down together to hash out these points, and so in October 2015, 20 members of the group met at the ASA Office in Alexandria, Virginia. The 2-day meeting was facilitated by Regina Nuzzo, and by the end of the meeting, a good set of points around which the statement could be built was developed. The next 3 months saw multiple drafts of the statement, reviewed by group members, by Board members (in a lengthy discussion at the November 2015 ASA Board meeting), and by members of the target audience. Finally, on January 29, 2016, the Executive Committee of the ASA approved the statement. The statement development process was lengthier and more controversial than anticipated. For example, there was considerable discussion about how best to address the issue of multiple potential comparisons (Gelman and Loken 2014). We debated at some length the issues behind the words a p-value near 0.05 taken by itself offers only weak evidence against the null",

To isolate the effects of physical and virtual navigation, a second experiment compared conditions where participants could navigate using either only physical movement or only virtual navigation.

                  "abstract": "Interactive visual applications often rely on animation to transition from one display state to another. There are multiple animation techniques to choose from, and it is not always clear which should produce the best visual correspondences between display elements. One major factor is whether the animation relies on staggering-an incremental delay in start times across the moving elements. It has been suggested that staggering may reduce occlusion, while also reducing display complexity and producing less overwhelming animations, though no empirical evidence has demonstrated these advantages. Work in perceptual psychology does show that reducing occlusion, and reducing inter-object proximity (crowding) more generally, improves performance in multiple object tracking. We ran simulations confirming that staggering can in some cases reduce crowding in animated transitions involving dot clouds (as found in, e.g., animated 2D scatterplots). We empirically evaluated the effect of two staggering techniques on tracking tasks, focusing on cases that should most favour staggering. We found that introducing staggering has a negligible, or even negative, impact on multiple object tracking performance. The potential benefits of staggering may be outweighed by strong costs: a loss of common-motion grouping information about which objects travel in similar paths, and less predictability about when any specific object would begin to move. Staggering may be beneficial in some conditions, but they have yet to be demonstrated. The present results are a significant step toward a better understanding of animation pacing, and provide direction for further research.",

Yet the dynamic nature of social media networks requires powerful visualization techniques that go beyond static network diagrams. To provide strong temporal network visualization tools, designers need to understand what tasks the users have to accomplish. This paper describes a taxonomy of temporal network visualization tasks. We identify the 1) entities, 2) properties, and 3) temporal features, which were extracted by surveying 53 existing temporal network visualization systems. By building and examining the task taxonomy, we report which tasks are well covered by existing systems and make suggestions for designing future visualization tools. The feedback from 12 network analysts helped refine the taxonomy.",

Pairs collaborated on a problem-solving task using a 2.8m  1.2m multitouch display with 24.8 megapixels. The study examines how participants collaborate; navigate relative to the display and to each other; and interact with and share the display. Participants physically navigated among different parts of the display, switched fluidly between parallel and joint work, and shared the display evenly.

Previous work has experimentally compared animation, small multiples, and other techniques, and found trade-offs between these. One potential way to avoid such trade-offs is to combine previous techniques in a hybrid visualization. We present two taxonomies of visualizations of dynamic graphs: one of non-hybrid techniques, and one of hybrid techniques. We also describe a prototype, called DiffAni, that allows a graph to be visualized as a sequence of three kinds of tiles: diff tiles that show difference maps over some time interval, animation tiles that show the evolution of the graph over some time interval, and small multiple tiles that show the graph state at an individual time slice. This sequence of tiles is ordered by time and covers all time slices in the data. An experimental evaluation of DiffAni shows that our hybrid approach has advantages over non-hybrid techniques in certain cases.",

However, there are two ways in which space can be provided to the user: by creating a physical workspace that the user can interact with directly, such as can be provided by a large, high-resolution display, or through the use of a virtual workspace that the user navigates using virtual navigation techniques such as zoom and pan. In this study we explicitly examined the use of spatial sensemaking techniques within these two environments. The results demonstrate that these two approaches to providing sensemaking space are not equivalent, and that the greater embodiment afforded by the physical workspace changes how the space is perceived and used, leading to increased externalization of the sensemaking process.",

We analyzed findings made by the study participants with flow maps, one of the most popular representations of spatial interactions, using animation and smallmultiples as two alternative ways of representing temporal changes. Our goal was not to measure the subjects performance with the two views, but to find out whether there are qualitative differences between the types of findings users make with these two representations. To achieve this goal we performed a deep analysis of the collected findings, the interaction logs, and the subjective feedback from the users. We observed that with animation the subjects tended to make more findings concerning geographically local events and changes between subsequent years. With smallmultiples more findings concerning longer time periods were made.

                  "abstract": "The analysis of large dynamic networks poses a challenge in many fields, ranging from large bot-nets to social networks. As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the users overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.",

Node-link-based visualization techniques are currently widely used for these tasks and have been demonstrated to be effective, but it was found that they also have limitations in representing temporal changes, particularly at the individual and subgroup levels. To overcome these limitations, this article presents a new network visualization technique, called TimeMatrix, based on a matrix representation. Interaction techniques, such as overlay controls, a temporal range slider, semantic zooming, and integrated network statistical measures, support analysts in studying temporal social networks. To validate the design, the article presents a user study involving three social scientists analyzing inter-organizational collaboration data. The study demonstrates how TimeMatrix may help analysts gain insights about the temporal aspects of network data that can be subsequently tested with network analytic methods.",

Applying social network analysis (SNA) algorithms to these networks produces additional attributes such as degree, centrality, and clustering coefficients. Understanding the effects of this plethora of attributes is one of the main challenges of multivariate SNA. We present the design of GraphDice, a multivariate network visualization system for exploring the attribute space of edges and actors. GraphDice builds upon the ScatterDice system for its main multidimensional navigation paradigm, and extends it with novel mechanisms to support network exploration in general and SNA tasks in particular. Novel mechanisms include visualization of attributes of interval type and projection of numerical edge attributes to node attributes. We show how these extensions to the original ScatterDice system allow to support complex visual analysis tasks on networks with hundreds of actors and up to 30 attributes, while providing a simple and consistent interface for interacting with network data.",

This technique has recently gained new prominence for presentations, most notably with Gapminder Trendalyzer. In Trendalyzer, animation together with interesting data and an engaging presenter helps the audience understand the results of an analysis of the data. It is less clear whether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by-side. The paper evaluates the three visualizations for both analysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors. Animation is the least effective form for analysis; both static depictions of trends are significantly faster than animation, and the small multiples display is more accurate.",

Some tasks require frequent movements and scale changes to search for details and compare them. We present a model that makes predictions about user performance on such comparison tasks with different interface options. A critical factor embodied in this model is the limited capacity of visual working memory, allowing for the cost of visits via fixating eye movements to be compared to the cost of visits that require user interaction with the mouse. This model is tested with an experiment that compares a zooming user interface with a multi-window interface for a multiscale pattern matching task. The results closely matched predictions in task performance times; however error rates were much higher with zooming than with multiple windows. We hypothesized that subjects made more visits in the multi-window condition, and ran a second experiment using an eye tracker to record the pattern of fixations. This revealed that subjects made far more visits back and forth between pattern locations when able to use eye movements than they made with the zooming interface. The results suggest that only a single graphical object was held in visual working memory for comparisons mediated by eye movements, reducing errors by reducing the load on visual working memory. Finally we propose a design heuristic: extra windows are needed when visual comparisons must be made involving patterns of a greater complexity than can be held in visual working memory.",

Although researchers have articulated qualitative benefits of group work on large displays, little work has been done to quantify the benefits for individual users. In this article we present four experiments comparing the performance of users working on a large projected wall display to that of users working on a standard desktop monitor. In these experiments, we held the visual angle constant by adjusting the viewing distance to each of the displays. Results from the first two experiments suggest that physically large displays, even when viewed at identical visual angles as smaller ones, help users perform better on mental rotation tasks. We show through the experiments how these results may be attributed, at least in part, to large displays immersing users within the problem space and biasing them into using more efficient cognitive strategies. In the latter two experiments, we extend these results, showing the presence of these effects with more complex tasks, such as 3D navigation and mental map formation and memory. Results further show that the effects of physical display size are independent of other factors that may induce immersion, such as interactivity and mental aids within the virtual environments. We conclude with a general discussion of the findings and possibilities for future work.",

Alternatively, data from all the timepoints can be overlaid simultaneously by embedding small charts into graph vertices. These graph visualizations may also be linked to other visualizations (e.g., parallel co-ordinates) using brushing and linking. This paper describes a study performed to evaluate and rank graph+timeseries visualization options based on users performance time and accuracy of responses on predefined tasks. The results suggest that overlaying data on graph vertices one timepoint at a time may lead to more accurate performance for tasks involving analysis of a graph at a single timepoint, and comparisons between graph vertices for two distinct timepoints. Overlaying data simultaneously for all the timepoints on graph vertices may lead to more accurate and faster performance for tasks involving searching for outlier vertices displaying different behavior than the rest of the graph vertices for all timepoints. Single views have advantage over multiple views on tasks that require topological information. Also, the number of attributes displayed on nodes has a non trivial influence on accuracy of responses, whereas the number of visualizations affect the performance time.",

This was found to be true even when the displays presented the same images at equivalent visual angles. Further investigation has suggested that large displays may provide a greater sense of presence, which biases users into adopting more efficient strategies to perform tasks. In this work, we extend those findings, demonstrating that users are more effective at performing 3D virtual navigation tasks on large displays. We also show that even though interacting with the environment affects performance, effects induced by interactivity are independent of those induced by physical display size.

                  "abstract": "This paper introduces an approach for organizational redesign and optimization of communication flows based on temporal analysis of communication patterns in groups of people. Our Temporal Communication Flow Visualizer automatically generates interactive movies of communication flows among individuals by mining email log files and other communication archives. Combining those movies with measures of social network analysis such as the change over time in group betweeness centrality (GBC) and group density leads to deep insights into organizational dynamics. In addition we have defined a contribution index, which measures the activity of an individual as a sender and receiver of messages relative to a team. Based on these findings we can make predictions on the productivity of teams and suggest interventions for improved performance. DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE OF TECFLOW Our Temporal Communication Flow Visualizer for the temporal analysis of social networks (TeCFlow) addresses three areas of related research: (1) visualization of social networks, (2) temporal analysis of social networks in animated visualizations, and (3) analysis of e-mail networks. TeCFlow takes as input e-mail archives and automatically generates static and dynamic visualizations of the calculated communication networks. The static visualizations allow users to step through a chosen time period by looking at communication networks at subsequent time intervals. The dynamic visualization consists of an interactive movie showing the evolution over time of the communication network within the group. Active relationships are displayed in a sliding time window, with inactive relationships decaying over time. TeCFlow also calculates and plots the evolution of group betweeness centrality and density over time to discover interesting events in the lifetime of a virtual team. The interactive movie can be stopped anytime to drill-down into the messages that are currently exchanged between actors. Multiple e-mail addresses can be combined into an online personality, reflecting the fact that people frequently use different e-mail addresses. We have implemented an open architecture. E-mail messages are processed locally in three steps (figure 1). In the first step, the e-mail messages and mailing lists are parsed and stored in decomposed format in a mysql database on the local machine. In the second step the database can be queried to select messages sent or received by a group in a given time period. In the third step the selected communication flows can be represented in our visual browser using our own netgraph [6] and static and dynamic views [5]. This architecture provides a tested of high scalability and flexibility. The number of actors, ties, and messages to be analyzed is only limited by the size of the database and the amount of RAM available, and temporal queries can be run in an ad hoc way. We are also able to experiment with different visualizations of the retrieved structure and to easily add other social web applications. Figure 1. TeCFlow Architecture We base our algorithm on the Fruchterman-Reingold graph drawing algorithm [4] for force-directed placement, which is commonly used to visualize social networks. This method compares a graph to a mechanical collection of electrically charged rings (the vertices) and connecting springs (the edges). Every two vertices reject each other with a repulsive force, and adjacent vertices (connected by an edge) are pulled together by an attractive force. Over a number of iterations, the forces modeled by the springs From:",

A preliminary user study was carried out to provide some initial evidence about the benefits of large versus small display surfaces for complex, multi-application office work. Significant benefits were observed in the use of a prototype, larger display, in addition to significant positive user preference and satisfaction with its use over a small display.

More recently, graphics have been used to portray things that are metaphorically spatiovisual, like graphs and organizational charts. The assumption is that graphics can facilitate comprehension, learning, memory, communication and inference. Assumptions aside, research on static graphics has shown that only carefully designed and appropriate graphics prove to be beneficial for conveying complex systems. Effective graphics conform to the Congruence Principle according to which the content and format of the graphic should correspond to the content and format of the concepts to be conveyed. From this, it follows that animated graphics should be effective in portraying change over time. Yet the research on the efficacy of animated over static graphics is not encouraging. In cases where animated graphics seem superior to static ones, scrutiny reveals lack of equivalence between animated and static graphics in content or procedures; the animated graphics convey more information or involve interactivity. Animations of events may be ineffective because animations violate the second principle of good graphics, the Apprehension Principle, according to which graphics should be accurately perceived and appropriately conceived. Animations are often too complex or too fast to be accurately perceived. Moreover, many continuous events are conceived of as sequences of discrete steps. Judicious use of interactivity may overcome both these disadvantages. Animations may be more effective than comparable static graphics in situations other than conveying complex systems, for example, for real time reorientations in time and space.",

These devices potentially represent an affordable alternative to the more traditional, centralised CAVE-style immersive environments. One driver for the development of CAVE-style immersive environments has been collaborative sense-making. Despite this, there has been little research on the effectiveness of collaborative visualisation in CAVE-style facilities, especially with respect to abstract data visualisation tasks. Indeed, very few studies have focused on the use of these displays to explore and analyse abstract data such as networks and there have been no formal user studies investigating collaborative visualisation of abstract data in immersive environments. In this paper we present the results of the first such study. It explores the relative merits of HMD and CAVE-style immersive environments for collaborative analysis of network connectivity, a common and important task involving abstract data. We find significant differences between the two conditions in task completion time and the physical movements of the participants within the space: participants using the HMD were faster while the CAVE2 condition introduced an asymmetry in movement between collaborators. Otherwise, affordances for collaborative data analysis offered by the low-cost HMD condition were not found to be different for accuracy and communication with the CAVE2. These results are notable, given that the latest HMDs will soon be accessible (in terms of cost and potentially ubiquity) to a massive audience.",

We define a time-dependent dataset as a sequence of datasets captured at particular time steps. In such a sequence, each dataset is composed of observations (high-dimensional real vectors), and each observation has a corresponding observation across time steps. Dimensionality reduction provides a scalable alternative to create visualizations (projections) that enable insight into the structure of such datasets. However, applying dimensionality reduction independently for each dataset in a sequence may introduce unnecessary variability in the resulting sequence of projections, which makes tracking the evolution of the data significantly more challenging. We show that this issue affects t-SNE, a widely used dimensionality reduction technique. In this context, we propose dynamic t-SNE, an adaptation of t-SNE that introduces a controllable trade-off between temporal coherence and projection reliability. Our evaluation in two time-dependent datasets shows that dynamic t-SNE eliminates unnecessary temporal variability and encourages smooth changes between projections.",

Examples of such patterns include slow and regular progressions, large sudden changes, and reversals to previous states. These patterns can be of interest in a range of domains, such as collaborative document editing, dynamic network analysis, and video analysis. Time curves employ the metaphor of folding a timeline visualization into itself so as to bring similar time points close to each other. This metaphor can be applied to any dataset where a similarity metric between temporal snapshots can be defined, thus it is largely datatype-agnostic.

A great number of studies on these objects start by aggregating the data on disjoint time windows of length  in order to obtain a series of graphs on which are made all subsequent analyses. Here we are concerned with the impact of the chosen  on the obtained graph series. We address the fundamental question of knowing whether a series of graphs formed using a given  faithfully describes the original link stream. We answer the question by showing that such dynamic networks exhibit a threshold for , which we call the saturation scale, beyond which the properties of propagation of the link stream are altered, while they are mostly preserved before. We design an automatic method to determine the saturation scale of any link stream, which we apply and validate on several real-world datasets.",

Often these networks are dynamic: they have a structural as well as a temporal aspect. In addition to relations occurring over time, node information is frequently present such as hierarchical structure or time-series data. We present a technique that extends the Massive Sequence View ( msv) for the analysis of temporal and structural aspects of dynamic networks. Using features in the data as well as Gestalt principles in the visualization such as closure, proximity, and similarity, we developed node reordering strategies for the msv to make these features stand out that optionally take the hierarchical node structure into account. This enables users to find temporal properties such as trends, counter trends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in the network as well as structural properties such as communities and stars. We introduce the circular msv that further reduces visual clutter. In addition, the (circular) msv is extended to also convey time-series data associated with the nodes. This enables users to analyze complex correlations between edge occurrence and node attribute changes. We show the effectiveness of the reordering methods on both synthetic and a rich real-world dynamic network data set.",

They are considered to provide valuable information from the viewpoints of sociology, linguistics, and marketing. This paper proposes a novel system for analyzing temporal changes in the activities and interests of bloggers through a 3D visualization of phrase dependency structures in sentences. We first extract events that represent bloggers activities and interests through analyzing the phrase dependencies of sentences in a blog archive. We roughly categorize the retrieved events according to the thematic roles (such as the experiencer, agent, and location) of the noun within the events, and then store them in a dependency database so that we can retrieve events that involve a given topic. Second, we present a 3D visualization framework for exploring temporal changes in events related to a topic. Our framework enables users to find events about a topic that appear within a specific timing, and drill down details of the events. It also enables users to compare events with different timings and/or on multiple topics. Moreover, it allows them to observe an overview of temporal changes in sets of events, and long-term changes in the frequency of events to assist users in finding trends. We implement the proposed system on our own five-year blog archive that focused on Japanese, and we report the usefulness of our system by using various examples.",

As an alternative and supplementation to the numerous other approaches to visualization of social network data and as an attempt to overcome some of the drawbacks of these approaches, DySoN interactively visualizes streaming event data of social interactions by an interactive three-dimensional model of interpolated NURBS tubes, representing activity and social proximity within a given set of actors during a given time period by using three dimensions of temporal information mapping: spatial density (tube distance), tubecolor and tube-diameter. We use a self assembled large collaboration network of Jazz musicians with a straightforward semantics for the computation of relation strengths for the evaluation of the approach. We also discuss applications of the concept for awareness services in mobile peer to peer social networks, which exhibit a vivid measurable social micro dynamics in time and space.",

We find that in all types of spatialization displays, there is no significant difference between default and direct judgements of distance; people clearly interpret default distance instructions to refer to direct (straightline) distance. These findings provide direct evidence on the conditions under which people employ distance when assessing similarity between data objects in various types of spatialized views and, when they do, which type of distance.

Initial experiments showed equivalent tracking accuracy for objects in 2-D and 3-D motion. Subsequent experiments manipulated the speeds of objects independent of the speed of the scene as a whole. Results showed that tracking accuracy was influenced by object speed but not by scene speed. This held true whether the scene underwent translation, zoom, rotation, or even combinations of all 3 motions. A final series of experiments interfered with observers ability to see a coherent scene by moving objects at different speeds from one another and by distorting the perception of 3-D space. These reductions in scene coherence led to reduced tracking accuracy, confirming that tracking is accomplished using a scene-based, or allocentric, frame of reference.",

To understand large structures it is often necessary to show both small-scale and large-scale structures. This has been called the problem of focus and context. Distortion, rapid zooming, elision and multiple windows are all techniques that have been developed to provide both focus and context within single representations. We review these techniques and argue that 3D visualization has a number of advantages. A system called NestedVision3D (NV3D) will be presented that has been developed to investigate the use of 3D visualization for understanding the structure of large computer programs. NV3D is a system for visualizing large nested graphs using interactive 3D graphics. It has been tested with graphs containing more than 35,000 nodes and 100,000 relationships. We describe NV3D and its design philosophy. Basic navigation is facilitated by a set of 3D widgets, rapid scaling and interactive elision. More experimental features include animations called snakes, which are used to trace dynamic software behavior.",

We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees.",

It is often visualized as secondary information on top of primary information, such as the spatial positions of elements on maps and charts. Visualizing the temporal evolution of such set diagrams as well as their primary features is quite important; however, conventional approaches have only focused on the temporal behavior of the primary features and do not provide an effective means to highlight notable transitions within the set relationships. This paper presents an approach for generating a stepwise animation between set diagrams by decomposing the entire transition into atomic changes associated with individual data elements. The key idea behind our approach is to optimize the ordering of the atomic changes such that the synthesized animation minimizes unwanted set occlusions by considering their depth ordering and reduces the gaze shift between two consecutive stepwise changes. Experimental results and a user study demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively facilitates the visual identification of the detailed transitions inherent in dynamic set diagrams.",

In many applications, the relations change over time and so does the hierarchical group structure. We developed a visualization technique that supports the analysis of the topology and the hierarchical group structure of a dynamic graph and the tracking of changes over time. Each graph of a sequence is visualized by an adjacency matrix, where the hierarchical group structure is encoded within the matrix using indentation and nested contours, complemented by icicle plots attached to the matrices. The density within and between subgroups of the hierarchy is represented within the matrices using a gray scale. To visualize changes, transitions and dissimilarities between the hierarchically structured graphs are shown using a flow metaphor and color coding. The design of our visualization technique allows us to show more than one hierarchical group structure of the same graph by stacking the sequences, where hierarchy comparison is supported not only within but also between sequences. To improve the readability, we minimize the number of crossing curves within and between sequences based on a sorting algorithm that sweeps through the sequences of hierarchies.",

In realworld systems, the graph topology is oftentimes not static but changes over time and hence, also the community structure changes. Previous timelinebased approaches either visualize the dynamic graph or the dynamic community structure. In contrast, our approach combines both in a single image and therefore allows users to investigate the community structure together with the underlying dynamic graph. Our optimized ordering of vertices and selection of colours in combination with interactive highlighting techniques increases the traceability of communities along the time axis. Users can identify visual signatures, estimate the reliability of the derived community structure and investigate whether community evolution interacts with changes in the graph topology. The utility of our approach is demonstrated in two application examples.",

The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.",

Only if we can assign significance to the partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural changes from random fluctuations.

Such data pose challenges for standard Markov order detection methods and demand modelling techniques that explicitly account for the graph constraint. Adopting a multi-order modelling framework for paths, we develop a Bayesian learning technique that (i) more reliably detects the correct Markov order compared to a competing method based on the likelihood ratio test, (ii) requires considerably less data compared to methods using AIC or BIC, and (iii) is robust against partial knowledge of the underlying constraints. We further show that a recently published method that uses a likelihood ratio test has a tendency to overfit the true Markov order of paths, which is not the case for our Bayesian technique. Our method is important for data scientists analyzing patterns in categorical sequence data that are subject to (partially) known constraints, e.g. sequences with forbidden words, mobility trajectories and click stream data, or sequence data in bioinformatics. Addressing the key challenge of model selection, our work is further relevant for the growing body of research that emphasizes the need for higher-order models in network analysis.",

Many tools of network analysis, like centrality measures, information ranking, or cluster detection rest on the assumption that links capture direct influence, and that paths represent possible indirect influence. This assumption is invalidated in time-stamped network data capturing, e.g., dynamic social networks, biological sequences or financial transactions. In such data, for two time-stamped links (A,B) and (B,C) the chronological ordering and timing determines whether a causal path from node A via B to C exists. A number of works has shown that for that reason network analysis cannot be directly applied to time-stamped network data. Existing methods to address this issue require statistics on causal paths, which is computationally challenging for big data sets. Addressing this problem, we develop an efficient algorithm to count causal paths in time-stamped network data. Applying it to empirical data, we show that our method is more efficient than a baseline method implemented in an OpenSource data analytics package. Our method works efficiently for different values of the maximum time difference between consecutive links of a causal path and supports streaming scenarios. With it, we are closing a gap that hinders an efficient analysis of big time series data on complex networks.",

Such data are important, e.g., when studying click streams in the Web, travel patterns in transportation systems, information cascades in social networks, biological pathways, or time-stamped social interactions. While it is common to apply graph analytics and network analysis to such data, recent works have shown that temporal correlations can invalidate the results of such methods. This raises a fundamental question: When is a network abstraction of sequential data justified?Addressing this open question, we propose a framework that combines Markov chains of multiple, higher orders into a multi-layer graphical model that captures temporal correlations in pathways at multiple length scales simultaneously. We develop a model selection technique to infer the optimal number of layers of such a model and show that it outperforms baseline Markov order detection techniques. An application to eight real-world data sets on pathways and temporal networks shows that it allows to infer graphical models that capture both topological and temporal characteristics of such data. Our work highlights fallacies of network abstractions and provides a principled answer to the open question when they are justified. Generalizing network representations to multi-order graphical models, it opens perspectives for new data mining and knowledge discovery algorithms.",

In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novel visual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of the global ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multiple views to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., the global, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of interest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-order nodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is enabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level. Using the global ocean shipping network data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a real-world use case conducted by domain experts specializing in species invasion. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of this framework to other real-world applications such as information diffusion in social networks and epidemic spreading through air transportation.",

Here, we analyze data on face-to-face contacts collected in an office building. The statistical properties of contacts are similar to other social situations, but important differences are observed in the contact network structure. In particular, the contact network is strongly shaped by the organization of the offices in departments, which has consequences in the design of accurate agent-based models of epidemic spread. We consider the contact network as a potential substrate for infectious disease spread and show that its sparsity tends to prevent outbreaks of rapidly spreading epidemics. Moreover, we define three typical behaviors according to the fraction f of links each individual shares outside its own department: residents, wanderers, and linkers. Linkers (f ~ 50%) act as bridges in the network and have large betweenness centralities. Thus, a vaccination strategy targeting linkers efficiently prevents large outbreaks. As such a behavior may be spotted a priori in the offices organization or from surveys, without the full knowledge of the time-resolved contact network, this result may help the design of efficient, low-cost vaccination or social-distancing strategies.",

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.",

A detailed description and quantification of contacts in hospitals provides key information for HAIs epidemiology and for the design and validation of control measures. Methods and Findings We used wearable sensors to detect close-range interactions (contacts) between individuals in the geriatric unit of a university hospital. Contact events were measured with a spatial resolution of about 1.5 meters and a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. The study included 46 HCWs and 29 patients and lasted for 4 days and 4 nights. 14,037 contacts were recorded overall, 94.1% of which during daytime. The number and duration of contacts varied between mornings, afternoons and nights, and contact matrices describing the mixing patterns between HCW and patients were built for each time period. Contact patterns were qualitatively similar from one day to the next. 38% of the contacts occurred between pairs of HCWs and 6 HCWs accounted for 42% of all the contacts including at least one patient, suggesting a population of individuals who could potentially act as super-spreaders. Conclusions Wearable sensors represent a novel tool for the measurement of contact patterns in hospitals. The collected data can provide information on important aspects that impact the spreading patterns of infectious diseases, such as the strong heterogeneity of contact numbers and durations across individuals, the variability in the number of contacts during a day, and the fraction of repeated contacts across days. This variability is however associated with a marked statistical stability of contact and mixing patterns across days. Our results highlight the need for such measurement efforts in order to correctly inform mathematical models of HAIs and use them to inform the design and evaluation of prevention strategies.",

The radial layoutencodes dynamic directed graphs on narrow rings of a circle. The temporal evolution of the graph is mapped torings that grow outward from the center of the circle. Graph vertices are placed equidistantly at the borderlinesof each ring. Graph edges are displayed as curved lines starting from a source on the inner borderline of thering and pointing to a target on the outer borderline. To better perceive link directions and structures of largedatasets, visual clutter is reduced by exploiting an edge splatting approach that generates density elds of thedisplayed edges. The radial layout emphasizes newer graphs, displayed in the larger, outer parts of the circle.As a benet, edge lengths are reduced in comparison to the non-radial visualization.

Describing and understanding contacts between children at school would help quantify the transmission opportunities of respiratory infections and identify situations within schools where the risk of transmission is higher. We report on measurements carried out in a French school (612 years children), where we collected data on the time-resolved face-to-face proximity of children and teachers using a proximity-sensing infrastructure based on radio frequency identification devices. Methods and Findings Data on face-to-face interactions were collected on Thursday, October 1st and Friday, October 2nd 2009. We recorded 77,602 contact events between 242 individuals (232 children and 10 teachers). In this setting, each child has on average 323 contacts per day with 47 other children, leading to an average daily interaction time of 176 minutes. Most contacts are brief, but long contacts are also observed. Contacts occur mostly within each class, and each child spends on average three times more time in contact with classmates than with children of other classes. We describe the temporal evolution of the contact network and the trajectories followed by the children in the school, which constrain the contact patterns. We determine an exposure matrix aimed at informing mathematical models. This matrix exhibits a class and age structure which is very different from the homogeneous mixing hypothesis. Conclusions We report on important properties of the contact patterns between school children that are relevant for modeling the propagation of diseases and for evaluating control measures. We discuss public health implications related to the management of schools in case of epidemics and pandemics. Our results can help define a prioritization of control measures based on preventive measures, case isolation, classes and school closures, that could reduce the disruption to education during epidemics.",

Compactness is achieved by aligning the nodes of a graph vertically. Edge crossings are reduced by drawing upward and downward edges separately as colored arcs. Horizontal alignment of the instances of the same node in different graphs facilitates comparison of the graphs in the sequence. Many interaction techniques allow to explore the given graphs. Smooth animation supports the user to better track the transitions between views and to preserve his or her mental map.

The goal is to present an animation based on a graph of temporal data, with every period pooled, followed up by each period graph successively. Our approach is based on a space-time analogy like for a clock. For each period, we propose to design a temporal mark, represented in a chronological order in the extremities of the visualization frame, like the hours on a clock.

However, they often produce extremely tangled results and exhibit impractical running times for highly non-planar graphs with large edge density. And very few graph layout algorithms support dynamic time-varying graphs; applying them independently to each frame produces distracting temporally incoherent visualizations. We have developed a new visualization technique based on a novel approach to hierarchically structuring dense graphs via stratification. Using this structure, we formulate a hierarchical force-directed layout algorithm that is both efficient and produces quality graph layouts. The stratification of the graph also allows us to present views of the data that abstract away many small details of its structure. Rather than displaying all edges and nodes at once, resulting in a convoluted rendering, we present an interactive tool that filters edges and nodes using the graph hierarchy and allows users to drill down into the graph for details. Our layout algorithm also accommodates time-varying graphs in a natural way, producing a temporally coherent animation that can be used to analyze and extract trends from dynamic graph data. For example, we demonstrate the use of our method to explore financial correlation data for the U.S. stock market in the period from 1990 to 2005. The user can easily analyze the time-varying correlation graph of the market, uncovering information such as market sector trends, representative stocks for portfolio construction, and the interrelationship of stocks over time.",

Drawings of these structures, as node and link diagrams, can provide a useful visualization of the underlying abstract data. This makes drawings of graphs a useful tool in information visualization. Indeed graph drawing has been applied in many application areas including software engineering, knowledge management and for depicting communication networks. The spatial layout can help the user build up a cognitive model or mental map of the information structure. Many automatic algorithms for producing drawings of a graph have been implemented. In many domains it is also common for the underlying information to be dynamic and this means the graph drawing must be updated. Unfortunately, even small changes to the underlying data can result in dramatic changes to the final drawing and this means the user may totally lose their previous mental map. Animation between the two versions of the layout is one approach that can assist the user to make the transition between the two drawings. We have been examining how to apply the Gestalt principles of organisation to this animation phase. The aim is to assist the user in understanding the structural and visual changes that have occurred in the layout. Results of that work are described with relevant examples.",

                  "abstract": "Many network problems are based on fundamental relationships involving time. Consider, for example, the problems of modeling the flow of information through a distributed network, studying the spread of a disease through a population, or analyzing the reachability properties of an airline timetable. In such settings, a natural model is that of a graph in which each edge is annotated with a time label specifying the time at which its endpoints communicated. We will call such a graph a temporal network. To model the notion that information in such a network flows only on paths whose labels respect the ordering of time, we call a path time-respecting if the time labels on its edges are non-decreasing. The central motivation for our work is the following question: how do the basic combinatorial and algorithmic properties of graphs change when we impose this additional temporal condition? The notion of a path is intrinsic to many of the most fundamental algorithmic problems on graphs; spanning trees, connectivity, flows, and cuts are some examples. When we focus on time-respecting paths in place of arbitrary paths, many of these problems acquire a character that is different from the traditional setting, but very rich in its own right. We provide results on two types of problems for temporal networks. First, we consider connectivity problems, in which we seek disjoint time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. The natural analogue of Mengers Theorem for node-disjoint paths fails in general for time-respecting paths; we give a non-trivial characterization of those graphs for which the theorem does hold in terms of an excluded subdivision theorem, and provide a polynomial-time algorithm for connectivity on this class of graphs. (The problem on general graphs is NP-complete.) We then define and study the class of inference problems, in which we seek to reconstruct a partially specified time labeling of a network in a manner consistent with an observed history of information flow.",

While most previous work has focused on studying network-wide properties and spotting outlier users, the dynamics of individual user interactions remain largely unexplored. This work sets out to explore those dynamics in a way that is minimally invasive to privacy, thus, avoids to rely on the textual content of user posts---except for validation. Our contributions are two-fold. First, in contrast to previous studies, we challenge the use of a fixed interval of observation. We introduce and empirically validate the Temporal Asymmetry Hypothesis, which states that appropriate observation intervals should vary both among users and over time for the same user. We validate this hypothesis using eight different datasets, including email, messaging, and social networks data. Second, we propose iNET, a comprehensive analytic and visualization framework which provides personalized insights into user behavior and operates in a streaming fashion. iNET learns personalized baseline behaviors of users and uses them to identify events that signify changes in user behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of iNET by analyzing more than half a million interactions from Facebook users. Labeling of the identified changes in user behavior showed that iNET is able to capture a wide spectrum of exogenous and endogenous events, while the baselines are less diverse in nature and capture only 66% of that spectrum. Furthermore, iNET exhibited the highest precision (95%) compared to all competing approaches.",

Through our user study, we confirm that users can find events of interests quickly from first-person videos thanks to the following benefits of using the EgoScanning interface: 1) adaptive changes of playback speeds allow users to watch fast-forwarded videos more easily; 2) Emphasized parts of videos can act as candidates of events actually significant to users; 3) Users are able to select relevant egocentric cues depending on events of their interests.",

Picking such a windowing of the data is often done by hand, or left up to the technology that is collecting the data. However, the choice can make a big difference in the properties of the dynamic network. This is the time scale detection problem. In previous work, this problem is often solved with a heuristic as an unsupervised task. As an unsupervised problem, it is difficult to measure how well a given algorithm performs. In addition, we show that the quality of the windowing is dependent on which task an analyst wants to perform on the network after windowing. Therefore the time scale detection problem should not be handled independently from the rest of the analysis of the network. We introduce a framework that tackles both of these issues: By measuring the performance of the time scale detection algorithm based on how well a given task is accomplished on the resulting network, we are for the first time able to directly compare different time scale detection algorithms to each other. Using this framework, we introduce time scale detection algorithms that take a supervised approach: they leverage ground truth on training data to find a good windowing of the test data. We compare the supervised approach to previous approaches and several baselines on real data.",

Picking such a windowing of the data is often done by hand, or left up to the technology that is collecting the data. However, the choice can make a big difference in the properties of the dynamic network. Finding a good windowing is the time scale detection problem. In previous work, this problem is often solved with an unsupervised heuristic. As an unsupervised problem, it is difficult to measure how well a given windowing algorithm performs. In addition, we show that there is little correlation between the quality of a windowing across different tasks. Therefore the time scale detection problem should not be handled independently from the rest of the analysis of the network. Given this, in accordance with standard supervised machine learning practices, we introduce new windowing algorithms that automatically adapt to the task the analyst wants to perform by treating windowing as a hyperparameter for the task, rather than using heuristics. This approach measures the quality of the windowing by how well a given task is accomplished on the resulting network. This also allows us, for the first time, to directly compare different windowing algorithms to each other, by comparing how well the task is accomplished using that windowing algorithm. We compare this approach to previous approaches and several baselines",

Existing solutions to this problem are usually good for the overview and presentation, but not for the interactive analysis. We propose in this paper a new approach which only considers the dynamic network central to a focus node (aka dynamic ego network). The navigation of the entire network is achieved by switching the focus node with user interactions. With this approach, the complexity of the compressed dynamic network is greatly reduced without sacrificing the network and time affinity central to the focus node. As a result, we are able to present each dynamic ego network in a single static view, well supporting user analysis on temporal network patterns. We describe our general framework including the network data pre-processing, 1.5D network and trend visualization design, layout algorithms, as well as several customized interactions. In addition, we show that our approach can also be extended to visualize the event-based and multimodal dynamic networks. Finally, we demonstrate, through two practical case studies, the effectiveness of our solution in support of visual evidence and pattern discovery.",

However, existing approaches often use out-of-the-box sequence models which are limited by speed and memory consumption, are often infeasible for production environments, and usually do not incorporate cross-session information, which is crucial for effective recommendations. Here we propose Hierarchical Temporal Convolutional Networks (HierTCN), a hierarchical deep learning architecture that makes dynamic recommendations based on users sequential multi-session interactions with items. HierTCN is designed for web-scale systems with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users. It consists of two levels of models: The high-level model uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to aggregate users evolving long-term interests across different sessions, while the low-level model is implemented with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), utilizing both the long-term interests and the short-term interactions within sessions to predict the next interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on a public XING dataset and a large-scale Pinterest dataset that contains 6 million users with 1.6 billion interactions. We show that HierTCN is 2.5x faster than RNN-based models and uses 90% less data memory compared to TCN-based models. We further develop an effective data caching scheme and a queue-based mini-batch generator, enabling our model to be trained within 24 hours on a single GPU. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic recommendation methods, with up to 18% improvement in recall and 10% in mean reciprocal rank.",

These information networks are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic. They are heterogeneous as they consist of multi-typed objects and relations, and they are dynamic as they are constantly evolving over time. One of the challenging issues in such heterogeneous and dynamic environments is to forecast those relationships in the network that will appear in the future. In this article, we try to solve the problem of continuous-time relationship prediction in dynamic and heterogeneous information networks. This implies predicting the time it takes for a relationship to appear in the future, given its features that have been extracted by considering both heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of the underlying network. To this end, we first introduce a feature extraction framework that combines the power of meta-path-based modeling and recurrent neural networks to effectively extract features suitable for relationship prediction regarding heterogeneity and dynamicity of the networks. Next, we propose a supervised non-parametric approach, called Non-Parametric Generalized Linear Model (Np-Glm), which infers the hidden underlying probability distribution of the relationship building time given its features. We then present a learning algorithm to train Np-Glm and an inference method to answer time-related queries. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic data and three real-world datasets, namely Delicious, MovieLens, and DBLP, demonstrate the effectiveness of Np-Glm in solving continuous-time relationship prediction problem vis--vis competitive baselines.",

In recent years, graph neural networks, which extend the neural network models to graph data, have attracted increasing attention. Graph neural networks have been applied to advance many different graph related tasks such as reasoning dynamics of physical system, graph classification and node classification. Most of the existing graph neural network models have been designed for static graphs, while many real-world graphs are inherently dynamic. For example, social networks are naturally evolving as new users joining and new relations being created. Current graph neural network models cannot utilize the dynamic information in dynamic graphs. However, the dynamic information has been proven to enhance the performance of many graph analytical tasks such as community detection and link prediction. Hence, it is necessary to design dedicated graph neural networks for dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DGNN, a new Dynamic Graph Neural Network model, which can model the dynamic information as the graph evolving. In particular, the proposed framework can keep updating node information by capturing the sequential information of edges, the time intervals between edges and information propagation coherently. Experimental results on various dynamic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

In this paper, we propose to study the network embedding problem and focus on modeling the linkage evolution in the dynamic network setting. To address this problem, we propose a deep dynamic network embedding method.

In real world, networks, like social network and biological networks, are dynamic and evolving over time. However, almost all the existing network embedding methods focus on static networks while ignore network dynamics. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning approach, DynamicTriad, to preserve both structural information and evolution patterns of a given network. The general idea of our approach is to impose triad, which is a group of three vertices and is one of the basic units of networks. In particular, we model how a closed triad, which consists of three vertices connected with each other, develops from an open triad that has two of three vertices not connected with each other. This triadic closure process is a fundamental mechanism in the formation and evolution of networks, thereby makes our model being able to capture the network dynamics and to learn representation vectors for each vertex at different time steps. Experimental results on three real-world networks demonstrate that, compared with several state-of-the-art techniques, DynamicTriad achieves substantial gains in several application scenarios. For example, our approach can effectively be applied and help to identify telephone frauds in a mobile network, and to predict whether a user will repay her loans or not in a loan network. ",

When studying the structure of OSNs such as Facebook, two of the most commonly studied networks are friendship and interaction networks. The link prediction problem in friendship networks has been heavily studied. There has also been prior work on link prediction in interaction networks,independent of friendship networks. In this paper, we study the predictive power of combining friendship and interaction networks. We hypothesize that, by leveraging friendship networks, we can improve the accuracy of link prediction in interaction networks. We augment several interaction link prediction algorithms to incorporate friendships and predicted friendships. From experiments on Facebook data, we find that incorporating friendships into interaction link prediction algorithms results in higher accuracy, but incorporating predicted friendships does not when compared to incorporating current friendships.

A critical task along this understanding is to predict the link state of the network at a future time given a collection of link states at earlier time points. In existing literature, this task is known as link prediction in dynamic networks. Solving this task is more difficult than its counterpart in static networks because an effective feature representation of node-pair instances for the case of dynamic network is hard to obtain. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method for metric embedding of node-pair instances of a dynamic network. The proposed method models the metric embedding task as an optimal coding problem where the objective is to minimize the reconstruction error, and it solves this optimization task using a gradient descent method. We validate the effectiveness of the learned feature representation by utilizing it for link prediction in various real-life dynamic networks. Specifically, we show that our proposed link prediction model, which uses the extracted feature representation for the training instances, outperforms several existing methods that use well-known link prediction features.",

However, little is known about the mechanisms of interactions between communities and how they impact users. Here we study intercommunity interactions across 36,000 communities on Reddit, examining cases where users of one community are mobilized by negative sentiment to comment in another community. We show that such conflicts tend to be initiated by a handful of communities---less than 1% of communities start 74% of conflicts. While conflicts tend to be initiated by highly active community members, they are carried out by significantly less active members. We find that conflicts are marked by formation of echo chambers, where users primarily talk to other users from their own community. In the long-term, conflicts have adverse effects and reduce the overall activity of users in the targeted communities. Our analysis of user interactions also suggests strategies for mitigating the negative impact of conflicts---such as increasing direct engagement between attackers and defenders. Further, we accurately predict whether a conflict will occur by creating a novel LSTM model that combines graph embeddings, user, community, and text features. This model can be used to create an early-warning system for community moderators to prevent conflicts. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of community interactions and conflict, and paves the way towards healthier online communities.",

In this paper, we study how to effectively treat contextual data in neural recommender systems. We begin with an empirical analysis of the conventional approach to context as features in feed-forward recommenders and demonstrate that this approach is inefficient in capturing common feature crosses. We apply this insight to design a state-of-the-art RNN recommender system. We first describe our RNN-based recommender system in use at YouTube. Next, we offer Latent Cross, an easy-to-use technique to incorporate contextual data in the RNN by embedding the context feature first and then performing an element-wise product of the context embedding with models hidden states.

Our analysis and proofs reveal that: (1) DeepWalk empirically produces a low-rank transformation of a networks normalized Laplacian matrix; (2) LINE, in theory, is a special case of DeepWalk when the size of vertices context is set to one; (3) As an extension of LINE, PTE can be viewed as the joint factorization of multiple networks Laplacians; (4) node2vec is factorizing a matrix related to the stationary distribution and transition probability tensor of a 2nd-order random walk. We further provide the theoretical connections between skip-gram based network embedding algorithms and the theory of graph Laplacian.

Most existing approaches learn node embeddings by exploring the structure of networks and are mainly focused on static non-attributed graphs. However, many real-world applications, such as stock markets and public review websites, involve bipartite graphs with dynamic and attributed edges, called attributed interaction graphs. Different from conventional graph data, attributed interaction graphs involve two kinds of entities (e.g. investors/stocks and users/businesses) and edges of temporal interactions with attributes (e.g. transactions and reviews). In this paper, we study the problem of node embedding in attributed interaction graphs. Learning embeddings in interaction graphs is highly challenging due to the dynamics and heterogeneous attributes of edges. Different from conventional static graphs, in attributed interaction graphs, each edge can have totally different meanings when the interaction is at different times or associated with different attributes. We propose a deep node embedding method called IGE (Interaction Graph Embedding). IGE is composed of three neural networks: an encoding network is proposed to transform attributes into a fixed-length vector to deal with the heterogeneity of attributes; then encoded attribute vectors interact with nodes multiplicatively in two coupled prediction networks that investigate the temporal dependency by treating incident edges of a node as the analogy of a sentence in word embedding methods. The encoding network can be specifically designed for different datasets as long as it is differentiable, in which case it can be trained together with prediction networks by back-propagation. We evaluate our proposed method and various comparing methods on four real-world datasets. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the learned embeddings by IGE on both node clustering and classification tasks.",

The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.",

                  "abstract": "In the study of various diseases, heterogeneity among patients usually leads to different progression patterns and may require different types of therapeutic intervention. Therefore, it is important to study patient subtyping, which is grouping of patients into disease characterizing subtypes. Subtyping from complex patient data is challenging because of the information heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been successfully used in many domains for processing sequential data, and recently applied for analyzing longitudinal patient records. The LSTM units are designed to handle data with constant elapsed times between consecutive elements of a sequence. Given that time lapse between successive elements in patient records can vary from days to months, the design of traditional LSTM may lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel LSTM unit called Time-Aware LSTM (T-LSTM) to handle irregular time intervals in longitudinal patient records. We learn a subspace decomposition of the cell memory which enables time decay to discount the memory content according to the elapsed time. We propose a patient subtyping model that leverages the proposed T-LSTM in an auto-encoder to learn a powerful single representation for sequential records of patients, which are then used to cluster patients into clinical subtypes. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show that the proposed T-LSTM architecture captures the underlying structures in the sequences with time irregularities.",

                  "abstract": "Recently, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) solutions for recommender systems (RS) are becoming increasingly popular. The insight is that, there exist some intrinsic patterns in the sequence of users actions, and RNN has been proved to perform excellently when modeling sequential data. In traditional tasks such as language modeling, RNN solutions usually only consider the sequential order of objects without the notion of interval. However, in RS, time intervals between users actions are of significant importance in capturing the relations of users actions and the traditional RNN architectures are not good at modeling them. In this paper, we propose a new LSTM variant, i.e. Time-LSTM, to model users sequential actions. Time-LSTM equips LSTM with time gates to model time intervals. These time gates are specifically designed, so that compared to the traditional RNN solutions, Time-LSTM better captures both of users shortterm and long-term interests, so as to improve the recommendation performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show the superiority of the recommendation method using TimeLSTM over the traditional methods.",

                  "abstract": "Network embedding leverages the node proximity manifested to learn a low-dimensional node vector representation for each node in the network. The learned embeddings could advance various learning tasks such as node classification, network clustering, and link prediction. Most, if not all, of the existing works, are overwhelmingly performed in the context of plain and static networks. Nonetheless, in reality, network structure often evolves over time with addition/deletion of links and nodes. Also, a vast majority of real-world networks are associated with a rich set of node attributes, and their attribute values are also naturally changing, with the emerging of new content patterns and the fading of old content patterns. These changing characteristics motivate us to seek an effective embedding representation to capture network and attribute evolving patterns, which is of fundamental importance for learning in a dynamic environment. To our best knowledge, we are the first to tackle this problem with the following two challenges: (1) the inherently correlated network and node attributes could be noisy and incomplete, it necessitates a robust consensus representation to capture their individual properties and correlations; (2) the embedding learning needs to be performed in an online fashion to adapt to the changes accordingly. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel dynamic attributed network embedding framework - DANE. In particular, DANE first provides an offline method for a consensus embedding and then leverages matrix perturbation theory to maintain the freshness of the end embedding results in an online manner. We perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real attributed networks to corroborate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.",

While understanding user intent is fundamental to the design and personalization of online platforms, little is known about how intent varies across individuals, or how it relates to their behavior. Here, we develop a framework for understanding intent in terms of goal specificity and temporal range. Our methodology combines survey-based methodology with an observational analysis of user activity. Applying this framework to Pinterest, we surveyed nearly 6000 users to quantify their intent, and then studied their subsequent behavior on the web site. We find that goal specificity is bimodal - users tend to be either strongly goal-specific or goal-nonspecific. Goal-specific users search more and consume less content in greater detail than goal-nonspecific users: they spend more time using Pinterest, but are less likely to return in the near future. Users with short-term goals are also more focused and more likely to refer to past saved content than users with long-term goals, but less likely to save content for the future. Further, intent can vary by demographic, and with the topic of interest. Last, we show that users intent and activity are intimately related by building a model that can predict a users intent for using Pinterest after observing their activity for only two minutes. Altogether, this work shows how intent can be predicted from user behavior.",

While prior work suggests that trolling behavior is confined to a vocal and antisocial minority, we demonstrate that ordinary people can engage in such behavior as well. We propose two primary trigger mechanisms: the individuals mood, and the surrounding context of a discussion (e.g., exposure to prior trolling behavior). Through an experiment simulating an online discussion, we find that both negative mood and seeing troll posts by others significantly increases the probability of a user trolling, and together double this probability. To support and extend these results, we study how these same mechanisms play out in the wild via a data-driven, longitudinal analysis of a large online news discussion community. This analysis exposes temporal mood effects, and explores long range patterns of repeated exposure to trolling. A predictive model of trolling behavior reveals that mood and discussion context together can explain trolling behavior better than an individuals history of trolling. These results combine to suggest that ordinary people can, under the right circumstances, behave like trolls.",

                  "abstract": "Recommender systems often use latent features to explain the behaviors of users and capture the properties of items. As users interact with different items over time, user and item features can influence each other, evolve and co-evolve over time. The compatibility of user and items feature further influence the future interaction between users and items. Recently, point process based models have been proposed in the literature aiming to capture the temporally evolving nature of these latent features. However, these models often make strong parametric assumptions about the evolution process of the user and item latent features, which may not reflect the reality, and has limited power in expressing the complex and nonlinear dynamics underlying these processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep coevolutionary network model (DeepCoevolve), for learning user and item features based on their interaction graph. DeepCoevolve use recurrent neural network (RNN) over evolving networks to define the intensity function in point processes, which allows the model to capture complex mutual influence between users and items, and the feature evolution over time. We also develop an efficient procedure for training the model parameters, and show that the learned models lead to significant improvements in recommendation and activity prediction compared to previous state-of-the-arts parametric models.",

                  "abstract": "Large volumes of event data are becoming increasingly available in a wide variety of applications, such as healthcare analytics, smart cities and social network analysis. The precise time interval or the exact distance between two events carries a great deal of information about the dynamics of the underlying systems. These characteristics make such data fundamentally different from independently and identically distributed data and time-series data where time and space are treated as indexes rather than random variables. Marked temporal point processes are the mathematical framework for modeling event data with covariates. However, typical point process models often make strong assumptions about the generative processes of the event data, which may or may not reflect the reality, and the specifically fixed parametric assumptions also have restricted the expressive power of the respective processes. Can we obtain a more expressive model of marked temporal point processes? How can we learn such a model from massive data? In this paper, we propose the Recurrent Marked Temporal Point Process (RMTPP) to simultaneously model the event timings and the markers. The key idea of our approach is to view the intensity function of a temporal point process as a nonlinear function of the history, and use a recurrent neural network to automatically learn a representation of influences from the event history. We develop an efficient stochastic gradient algorithm for learning the model parameters which can readily scale up to millions of events. Using both synthetic and real world datasets, we show that, in the case where the true models have parametric specifications, RMTPP can learn the dynamics of such models without the need to know the actual parametric forms; and in the case where the true models are unknown, RMTPP can also learn the dynamics and achieve better predictive performance than other parametric alternatives based on particular prior assumptions.",

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a nodes network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.",

Online users are constantly creating new links when they are exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes---information diffusion and network evolution---have been typically studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics. In this work, we propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other. The model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks. Moreover, we develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces. Experiments in both synthetic data and real data gathered from Twitter show that our model provides a good fit to the data as well as more accurate predictions than alternatives.",

We leverage multiple classical ML approaches, but develop 3 novel sets of features. Our Wikipedia Vandal Behavior (WVB) approach uses a novel set of user editing patterns as features to classify some users as vandals. Our Wikipedia Transition Probability Matrix (WTPM) approach uses a set of features derived from a transition probability matrix and then reduces it via a neural net auto-encoder to classify some users as vandals. The VEWS approach merges the previous two approaches. Without using any information (e.g. reverts) provided by other users, these algorithms each have over 85% classification accuracy. Moreover, when temporal recency is considered, accuracy goes to almost 90%. We carry out detailed experiments on a new data set we have created consisting of about 33K Wikipedia users (including both a black list and a white list of editors) and containing 770K edits. We describe specific behaviors that distinguish between vandals and non-vandals. We show that VEWS beats ClueBot NG and STiki, the best known algorithms today for vandalism detection. Moreover, VEWS detects far more vandals than ClueBot NG and on average, detects them 2.39 edits before ClueBot NG when both detect the vandal. However, we show that the combination of VEWS and ClueBot NG can give a fully automated vandal early warning system with even higher accuracy.",

Therefore, big data is the capability to manage a huge volume of disparate data, at the right speed, and within the right time frame to allow real-time analysis and reaction. As we note earlier in this chapter, big data is typically broken down by three characteristics: Volume:How much data Velocity:How fast that data is processed Variety:The various types of data Although its convenient to simplify big data into the three Vs, it can be misleading and overly simplistic. For example, you may be managing a relatively small amount of very disparate, complex data or you may be processing a huge volume of very simple data. That simple data may be all structured or all unstructured. Even more important is the fourth V:veracity. How accurate is that data in predicting business value?

We train a blend of matrix factorization methods that model the relation of the influencer, the influenced and the artist, both the individual factor decompositions and their weight learned by variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Special care is taken since events of influence form a subset of the positive implicit feedback data and hence we have to cope with two different definitions of the positive and negative implicit training data. In addition, in the time-aware setting we have to use online learning and evaluation methods. While SGD can easily be trained online, evaluation is cumbersome by traditional measures since we will have potentially different top recommendations at different times.

Although prior work in this area has developed sophisticated models for user activity, these models either ignore social network influence completely or incorporate it in an implicit manner. We overcome the nontransparency of the network in the model at the individual scale by proposing a coupled hidden Markov model (HMM), where each users activity evolves according to a Markov chain with a hidden state that is influenced by the collective activity of the friends of the user. We develop generalized Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithms for parameter learning and state estimation for the proposed framework. We then validate the proposed model using a significant corpus of user activity on Twitter. Our numerical studies show that with sufficient observations to ensure accurate model learning, the proposed framework explains the observed data better than either a renewal process-based model or a conventional (uncoupled) HMM. We also demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in predicting the time to the next tweet. Finally, clustering in the model parameter space is shown to result in distinct natural clusters of users characterized by the interaction dynamic between a user and his network.",

The problem of efficiently performing dynamic link inference is extremely challenging due to the dynamic nature in massive evolving networks especially when there exist sparse connectivities and nonlinear transitional patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, i.e., Conditional Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ctRBM), which predicts links based on individual transition variance as well as influence introduced by local neighbors. The proposed model is robust to noise and have the exponential capability to capture nonlinear variance. We tackle the computational challenges by developing an efficient algorithm for learning and inference of the proposed model. To improve the efficiency of the approach, we give a faster approximated implementation based on a proposed Neighbor Influence Clustering algorithm. Extensive experiments on simulated as well as real-world dynamic networks show that the proposed method outperforms existing algorithms in link inference on dynamic networks.",

While many social collaborative filtering approaches learn from aggregate statistics over this social information, we show that only a small subset of user interactions and activities are actually useful for social recommendation, hence learning which of these are most informative is of critical importance. To this end, we define a novel social collaborative filtering approach termed social affinity filtering (SAF). On a preference dataset of Facebook users and their interactions with 37,000+ friends collected over a four month period, SAF learns which fine-grained interactions and activities are informative and outperforms state-of-the-art (social) collaborative filtering methods by over 6% in prediction accuracy; SAF also exhibits strong cold-start performance. In addition, we analyse various aspects of fine-grained social features and show (among many insights) that interactions on video content are more informative than other modalities (e.g., photos), the most informative activity groups tend to have small memberships, and features corresponding to ``long-tailed content (e.g., music and books) can be much more predictive than those with fewer choices (e.g., interests and sports). In summary, this work demonstrates the substantial predictive power of fine-grained social features and the novel method of SAF to leverage them for state-of-the-art social recommendation.",

Since 2008, MOOCs have been run by a variety of public and elite universities, especially in North America. Many academics have taken interest in MOOCs recognising the potential to deliver education around the globe on an unprecedented scale; some of these academics are taking a research-oriented perspective and academic papers describing their research are starting to appear in the traditional media of peer reviewed publications. This paper presents a systematic review of the published MOOC literature (2008-2012): Forty-five peer reviewed papers are identified through journals, database searches, searching the Web, and chaining from known sources to form the base for this review. We believe this is the first effort to systematically review literature relating to MOOCs, a fairly recent but massively popular phenomenon with a global reach. The review categorises the literature into eight different areas of interest, introductory, concept, case studies, educational theory, technology, participant focussed, provider focussed, and other, while also providing quantitative analysis of publications according to publication type, year of publication, and contributors. Future research directions guided by gaps in the literature are explored.",

However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.",

Though this has been known for decades, colormaps with many colors across the visual spectra are often used to represent data, leading to the potential for misinterpretation or difficulty with interpretation by someone with this deficiency. Until the creation of the module presented here, there were no colormaps mathematically optimized for CVD using modern color appearance models. While there have been some attempts to make aesthetically pleasing or subjectively tolerable colormaps for those with CVD, our goal was to make optimized colormaps for the most accurate perception of scientific data by as many viewers as possible. We developed a Python module, cmaputil, to create CVD-optimized colormaps, which imports colormaps and modifies them to be perceptually uniform in CVD-safe colorspace while linearizing and maximizing the brightness range. The module is made available to the science community to enable others to easily create their own CVD-optimized colormaps. Here, we present an example CVD-optimized colormap created with this module that is optimized for viewing by those without a CVD as well as those with red-green colorblindness. This colormap, cividis, enables nearly-identical visual-data interpretation to both groups, is perceptually uniform in hue and brightness, and increases in brightness linearly.",

With visual analytics in particular, displays of large datasets quickly become crowded and unclear. Through observing the practices of analysts working with the event sequence visualization tool EventFlow, we identified three techniques to reduce initial visual complexity by reducing the number of event categories resulting in a simplified overview. For novice users, we suggest an initial pair of event categories to display. For advanced users, we provide six ranking metrics and display all pairs in a ranked list. Finally, we present the Event Category Matrix (ECM), which simultaneously displays overviews of every event category pair. In this work, we report on the development of these techniques through two formative usability studies and the improvements made as a result. The goal of our work is to investigate strategies that help users overcome the challenges associated with initial visual complexity and to motivate the use of simplified overviews in temporal event sequence analysis.",

Our generic visualization supports dynamic and weighted digraphs and is applied in the context of software evolution.

We study these questions using data from one of the largest product review websites where users can subscribe to one another. By applying both panel data and a flexible matching method, we find that as users become more popular, they produce more reviews and more objective reviews; however, their numeric ratings also systematically change and become more negative and more varied.

AER resizes edges between existing nodes when new edges are added before updating the visualization. SSBM initially positions multiple new nodes sequentially through priority based on the degree of connections to the existing graph. The proposed method prevents a decrease in readability at data update and achieves fast convergence with high accuracy.

Users are enabled to explore the state space by offering multiple alternatives from the current state. Users can then select the alternative of choice and continue the analysis.

As proof of concept the exploration method is implemented in a prototype. The effectiveness of the exploration method is tested using a formal user study comparing four different interaction methods. By using Small Multiples as data exploration method users need fewer steps in answering questions and also explore a significantly larger part of the state space in the same amount of time, providing them with a broader perspective on the data, hence lowering the chance of missing important features. Also, users prefer visual exploration with small multiples over nonsmall multiple variants.",

Previous work on trajectory visualization addresses selected aspects of this problem, but not all of them. We present a novel approach to visualizing trajectory attribute data. Our solution covers space, time, and attribute values. Based on an analysis of relevant visualization tasks, we designed the visualization solution around the principle of stacking trajectory bands. The core of our approach is a hybrid 2D/3D display. A 2D map serves as a reference for the spatial context, and the trajectories are visualized as stacked 3D trajectory bands along which attribute values are encoded by color. Time is integrated through appropriate ordering of bands and through a dynamic query mechanism that feeds temporally aggregated information to a circular time display. An additional 2D time graph shows temporal information in full detail by stacking 2D trajectory bands. Our solution is equipped with analytical and interactive mechanisms for selecting and ordering of trajectories, and adjusting the color mapping, as well as coordinated highlighting and dedicated 3D navigation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our novel visualization by three examples related to radiation surveillance, traffic analysis, and maritime navigation. User feedback obtained in a small experiment indicates that our hybrid 2D/3D solution can be operated quite well.",

Therefore, it is often difficult for users to recall their own exploration history or share it with others. We introduce GraphTrail, an interactive visualization for analyzing networks through exploration of node and edge aggregates that captures users interactions and integrates this history directly in the exploration workspace. To facilitate large network analysis, GraphTrail integrates aggregation with familiar charts, drag-and-drop interaction on a canvas, and a novel pivoting mechanism for transitioning between aggregates. Through a three-month field study with a team of archeologists and a qualitative lab study with ten users, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the benefits of integrated exploration history, including analysis comprehension, insight discovery, and exploration recall.",

The additional pixels are especially useful for information visualization where scalability has typically been limited by the number of pixels available on a display. But how will visualizations for larger displays need to fundamentally differ from visualizations on desktop displays? Are the basic visualization design principles different? With this potentially new design paradigm comes questions such as whether the relative effectiveness of various graphical encodings are different on large displays, which visualizations and datasets benefit the most, and how interaction with visualizations on large, high-resolution displays will need to change. As we explore these possibilities, we shift away from the technical limitations of scalability imposed by traditional displays (e.g. number of pixels) to studying the human abilities that emerge when these limitations are removed. There is much potential for information visualizations to benefit from large, high-resolution displays, but this potential will only be realized through understanding the interaction between visualization design, perception, interaction techniques, and the display technology. In this paper we present critical design issues and outline some of the challenges and future opportunities for designing visualizations for large, high-resolution displays. We hope that these issues, challenges, and opportunities will provide guidance for future research in this area.",

The dynamic and multi-relational nature of this data poses the challenge of understanding both its topological structure and how it changes over time. In this paper we propose a visual analytics approach for analyzing dynamic networks that integrates: a dynamic layout with user-controlled trade-off between stability and consistency; three temporal views based on different combinations of node-link diagrams (layer superimposition, layer juxtaposition, and two-and-a-half-dimensional view); the visualization of social network analysis metrics; and specific interaction techniques for tracking node trajectories and node connectivity over time. This integration of visual, interactive, and automatic methods supports the multi-faceted analysis of dynamically changing networks.",

We introduce a method for supporting this kind of multi-focus interaction that we call stack zooming. The approach is based on the user interactively building hierarchies of 1D strips stacked on top of each other, where each subsequent stack represents a higher zoom level, and sibling strips represent branches in the visual exploration. Correlation graphics show the relation between stacks and strips of different levels, providing context and distance awareness among the focus points. The zoom hierarchies can also be used as graphical histories and for communicating insights to stakeholders. We also discuss how visual spaces that support stack zooming can be extended with annotation and local statistics computations that fit the hierarchical stacking metaphor.",

Many algorithms have been proposed so far, but none of them has been subjected to strict tests to evaluate their performance. Most of the sporadic tests performed so far involved small networks with known community structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)] and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 7327 (2007); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 1118 (2008)], Blondel [J.

A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a users intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.",

Displays that are beyond visual acuity require physical navigation to see all of the pixels. Participants performed various information visualization tasks using display sizes with a sufficient number of pixels to be within, equal to, or beyond visual acuity. Results showed that performance on most tasks was more efficient and sometimes more accurate because of the additional data that could be displayed, despite the physical navigation that was required.

To successfully analyze and validate various hypothesis, it is necessary to pose several queries, correlate disparate data, and create insightful visualizations of both the simulated processes and observed phenomena. Often, insight comes from comparing the results of multiple visualizations. Unfortunately, today this process is far from interactive and contains many error-prone and time-consuming tasks. As a result, the generation and maintenance of visualizations is a major bottleneck in the scientific process, hindering both the ability to mine scientific data and the actual use of the data. The VisTrails system represents our initial attempt to improve the scientific discovery process and reduce the time to insight. In VisTrails, we address the problem of visualization from a data management perspective: VisTrails manages the data and metadata of a visualization product. In this demonstration, we show the power and flexibility of our system by presenting actual scenarios in which scientific visualization is used and showing how our system improves usability, enables reproducibility, and greatly reduces the time required to create scientific visualizations.",

This creates potential advantages for data visualization in that more dense data and fine details are viewable at once. Also, less navigation may be needed to see more data. However, little work has been done to determine the effectiveness of large high-resolution displays, especially for basic low-level data visualization and navigation tasks. This paper describes an exploratory study on the effects of a large tiled display with a resolution of 3840x3072 as compared to two smaller displays (1560x2048 and 1280x1024). We conclude that, with finely detailed data, higher resolution displays that use physical navigation significantly outperform smaller displays that use pan and zoom navigation. Qualitatively, we also conclude that use of the larger display is less stressful and creates a better sense of confidence than the smaller displays.",

Our computing literature visualization system, has four major components: A mapping of bibliographical data to relational schema coupled with an RDBMS to store the relational data, an interactive GUI that allows queries and the dynamic construction of graphs, a temporal graph layout algorithm, and an interactive visualization tool. We use a novel technique for visualization of large graphs that evolve through time. Given a dynamic graph, the layout algorithm produces two-dimensional representations of each timeslice, while preserving the mental map of the graph from one slice to the next. A combined view, with all the timeslices can also be viewed and explored. For our analysis we use data from the Association of Computing Machinerys Digital Library of Scientific Literature which contains more than one hundred thousand research papers and authors.

However, constraint-based layout often requires many individual constraints defined over specific nodes and node pairs. In addition to the effort of writing and maintaining a large number of similar constraints, such constraints are specific to the particular graph and thus cannot generalize to other graphs in the same domain. To facilitate the specification of customized and generalizable constraint layouts, we contribute SetCoLa: a domain-specific language for specifying high-level constraints relative to properties of the backing data. Users identify node sets based on data or graph properties and apply high-level constraints within each set. Applying constraints to node sets rather than individual nodes reduces specification effort and facilitates reapplication of customized layouts across distinct graphs. We demonstrate the conciseness, generalizability, and expressiveness of SetCoLa on a series of real-world examples from ecological networks, biological systems, and social networks.

While several existing tools allow users to visualize pre-defined networks, creating these networks from raw data remains a challenging task, often requiring users to program custom scripts or write complex SQL commands. Some existing tools also allow users to both visualize and model networks. Interaction techniques adopted by these tools often assume users know the exact conditions for defining edges in the resulting networks. This assumption may not always hold true, however. In cases where users do not know much about attributes in the dataset or when there are several attributes to choose from, users may not know which attributes they could use to formulate linking conditions. We propose an alternate interaction technique to model networks that allows users to demonstrate to the system a subset of nodes and links they wish to see in the resulting network. The system, in response, recommends conditions that can be used to model networks based on the specified nodes and links. In this paper, we show how such a demonstration-based interaction technique can be used to model networks by employing it in a prototype tool, Graphiti. Through multiple usage scenarios, we show how Graphiti not only allows users to model networks from a tabular dataset but also facilitates updating a pre-defined network with additional edge types.",

                  "abstract": "This paper highlights the importance of books as dynamic actors within the Republic of Letters by means of multi-layered visualizations of epistolary networks. In the past decade, it has become increasingly common to make use of networks to study shifts in early modern scholarly exchange. Originally, almost all of these studies employed a single-layered network where one node of the graph represents a correspondent, and an edge between a pair of nodes corresponds to a letter exchanged between them. However, reducing the complex society of the Republic of Letters to a network in which actors are connected by one single type suggests a static uniformity that barely takes into account the multi-faced dynamics of epistolary exchange. In addition to letters, the Republic of Letters was tied (and untied) together primarily by means of books: they could foster networks when given as gifts, as well as influence and endanger connections if enlisted on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Therefore, this paper intends to discuss an approach that integrates both letters and books in a unified, dynamic multi-layered network representation. To this end, the epistolary network of the Dutch philologist Nicolaas Heinsius (1620-1680) with the Florentine Medici court serves as a case study to illustrate the applicability of multi-layered networks in correspondence research.",

Groups can be disjoint or overlapping, and might be organized hierarchically. However, the underlying graph still needs to be represented for analyzing the data in more depth. This work surveys research in visualizing group structures as part of graph diagrams. A particular focus is the explicit visual encoding of groups, rather than only using graph layout to indicate groups implicitly. We introduce a taxonomy of visualization techniques structuring the field into four main categories: visual node attributes vary properties of the node representation to encode the grouping, juxtaposed approaches use two separate visualizations, superimposed techniques work with two aligned visual layers, and embedded visualizations tightly integrate group and graph representation. The derived taxonomies for group structure and visualization types are also applied to group visualizations of edges. We survey grouponly, groupnode, groupedge and groupnetwork tasks that are described in the literature as use cases of group visualizations. We discuss results from evaluations of existing visualization techniques as well as main areas of application. Finally, we report future challenges based on interviews we conducted with leading researchers of the field.",

They will need to accommodate a growing urban population who aspire for higher standards of living, while reducing the amount of energy and resources that are being consumed, and UIS planning will be central to address these challenges. A conceptual approach is taken in this article to envision the role and structure of UIS in future cities. First by recalling concepts of diminishing marginal returns from Joseph Tainter, a brief history of infrastructure planning is then offered, spanning from the early human settlements and the Roman aqueducts to modern planning. A discussion of the current structure and co-dependence of UIS follows, and ideas are presented to better engineer networked infrastructure systems, notably using elements of complexity science. Finally, some ideas are offered to leverage current advances in information technology to better coordinate UIS planning across various departments. Overall, UIS planning is bound to change dramatically, and better integrating them into networked infrastructure may be key to solve our current challenges in future cities.",

In this paper we review the task classification literature and report on current practices in construction and evaluation. We consider the stages of task classification construction and identify the associated threats to validity arising at each stage and in response to the different methods employed. We provide guidance on suitable validation approaches in order to mitigate these threats. We also consider the appropriateness of evaluation strategies according to the different aspects of the classification which they evaluate. In so doing, we seek to provide guidance for developers of classifications in determining appropriate construction and evaluation strategies when developing a classification, and also for those selecting between competing classifications for use in the design and evaluation processes.",

The exploration of such large graphs is often supported by guidance using a degree-of-interest (DOI) function. Although many DOIs exist, they do not differentiate entity types, rely on additional data, or require complex settings overburding the journalists. We present a novel DOI for graphs with multiple types of entities. We show the interesting subgraph around the focal node and offer information about possible further steps.

We have mapped the putative monoamine connections, as well as a subset of neuropeptide connections, in C. elegans based on new and published gene expression data. The monoamine and neuropeptide networks exhibit distinct topological properties, with the monoamine network displaying a highly disassortative star-like structure with a rich-club of interconnected broadcasting hubs, and the neuropeptide network showing a more recurrent, highly clustered topology. Despite the low degree of overlap between the extrasynaptic (or wireless) and synaptic (or wired) connectomes, we find highly significant multilink motifs of interaction, pinpointing locations in the network where aminergic and neuropeptide signalling modulate synaptic activity. Thus, the C. elegans connectome can be mapped as a multiplex network with synaptic, gap junction, and neuromodulator layers representing alternative modes of interaction between neurons. This provides a new topological plan for understanding how aminergic and peptidergic modulation of behaviour is achieved by specific motifs and loci of integration between hard-wired synaptic or junctional circuits and extrasynaptic signals wirelessly broadcast from a small number of modulatory neurons.",

The Square Visualization has two main goals: it can be used as an exploratory tool to gain a basic understanding of the network structure and of some network properties, for example, the presence of communities, or it can be used to present the results of a preexisting analysis in an easily accessible way. In both cases, good visualizations can play an important role in a SNA process. However, although today it is relatively easy to produce beautiful network diagrams using one of the many SNA software packages, producing insightful diagrams can be more challenging, especially when the network is large. We can emphasize many aspects while visualizing a social network, and some of them may create visual noise and hide other properties. Not surprisingly, when multilayer social networks are involved, these aspects are even more important. Therefore, in this chapter, we present different visualization approaches and exemplify them on our running example to highlight the kind of information that they can extract from a real multilayer network. Four Main Approaches There are two main aspects where visual representation of social networks can play a major role: the visualization of network structure, that is, the spatial disposition of its nodes and edges, and a visual representation of its numerical properties, corresponding to the various metrics that exist in SNA or to those described in Chapter 3. These two kinds of goals can also be merged into a single visualization, either by augmenting a graph with information about the metrics or using the metrics to remove irrelevant information from the graph. We have illustrated these four approaches in Figure 5.1, as described in the following. Among the visualizations focusing on the network structure, graphs and their application to social networks, known as sociograms (Moreno, 1934), have seen, so far, themostwidespread adoption (von Landesberger et al., 2011). This adoption has been so large and diffuse that outside of academic discourse, SNAand sociograms are sometimes perceived as synonyms. An example of this is the sociogram of the lunch layer in the AUCS network, shown in Figure 5.1a.",

Edge bundling techniques have been proposed to solve cluttering issue for standard graphs while few efforts were done to deal with the similar issue for multilayer graphs. In multilayer graphs scenario, not only the clutter induced by large amount of edges is a problem but also the fact that different type of edges can overlap each other making useless the final visualization. In this paper we introduce a new multilayer graph edge bundling technique that firstly produces a preliminary edge bundling independently of the different edge layers and then deals with the specificity of multilayer graphs where more than one type of edges can be routed on the same bundle. The proposed visualization is tested on a real world case study and the outcomes point out the ability of our proposal to discover patterns present in the data.",

While no data is available at this stage to examine the success of lobbies in exerting influence on specific policy issues, we perform a first systematic multi-layer network analysis of a large lobby registry. Here we focus on the domains of finance and climate and we combine information on affiliation and client relations from the EU transparency register with information about shareholding and interlocking directorates of firms. We find that the network centrality of lobby organizations has no simple relation with their lobbying budget. Moreover, different layers of the multiplex network provide complementary information to characterize organizations potential influence. At the aggregate level, it appears that while the domains of finance and climate are separated on the layer of affiliation relations, they become intertwined when economic relations are considered. Because groups of interest differ not only in their budget and network centrality but also in terms of their internal cohesiveness, drawing a map of both connections across and within groups is a precondition to better understand the dynamics of influence on policy making and the forces at play.",

This paper presents the user-centred design and implementation efforts of developing the Information Visualisation InfoVis module for NEI studies. We first describe a user-centred design approach to task analysis, visual representation selection and iterative validation and improvement. We then show how existing techniques, such as graph simplification, enriched visualisation algorithms and interactive features, can be usefully combined to aid users in gaining insights. We implement our techniques as a Drupal module, and demonstrate the utility of InfoVis through scenarios of constructing co-authorship network, nanomaterial terms co-occurrence network, NanoParticle Ontology tree and nanomaterial toxicity plot. Our design is supportive for analysts and researchers to identify concepts and relationships in NEI studies.",

Associative browsing represents a common and intuitive set of exploratory strategies in which users step iteratively from familiar to novel bits of information. In this paper, we examine associative browsing as a strategy for bottomup exploration of large, heterogeneous networks. We present Refinery, an interactive visualization system informed by guidelines for associative browsing drawn from literature on exploratory informationseeking. These guidelines motivate Refinerys query model, which allows users to simply and expressively construct queries using heterogeneous sets of nodes. This system computes degreeofinterest scores for associated content using a fast, randomwalk algorithm. Refinery visualizes query nodes within a subgraph of results, providing explanatory context, facilitating serendipitous discovery, and stimulating continued exploration. A study of 12 academic researchers using Refinery to browse publication data demonstrates how the system enables discovery of valuable new content, even within existing areas of expertise.",

A core task in network analysis is to evaluate and understand group cohesion; that is, to explain why groups of elements belong together based on the underlying structure of the network. We present Detangler, a system that supports visual analysis of group cohesion in multiplex networks through dual linked views. These views feature new data abstractions derived from the original multiplex network: the substrate network and the catalyst network. We contribute two novel techniques that allow the user to analyze the complex structure of the multiplex network without the extreme visual clutter that would result from simply showing it directly. The harmonized layout visual encoding technique provides spatial stability between the substrate and catalyst views. The pivot brushing interaction technique supports linked highlighting between the views based on computations in the underlying multiplex network to leapfrog between subsets of catalysts and substrates. We present results from the motivating application domain of annotated news documents with a usage scenario and preliminary expert feedback. A second usage scenario presents group cohesion analysis of the social network of the early American independence movement.",

We examined multiple, directed link types in a criminal network. Eight distinct link types were identified, each one related to the exchange of a particular resource (e.g. drugs, money). The analyses focused on the eight link-type network layers and a merged network representing links across all eight layers. We were able to determine the link type of around 31% of the links, and found that nearly 50% of the nodes were involved in more than one network layer. This suggests that many actors contribute in multiple, diverse ways to the operation of the network. Actors were found to specialise in the exchange of particular types of resources, and also to specialise in the strategic position they occupied in the transfer of particular resources.",

We evaluate various representations and juxtaposition designs for visualizing adjacency matrices through a series of controlled experiments. We investigate the effect of using square matrices and triangular matrices on the speed and accuracy of performing graphical-perception tasks. Based on human symmetric perception, we propose two alternative juxtaposition designs to the conventional side-by-side juxtaposition, and study how users perform visual search and comparison tasks regarding different juxtaposition types. Our results show that the matrix representations have similar performance, and the matrix juxtaposition types perform differently. With the design guidelines derived from our studies, we present a compact visualization termed TileMatrix for juxtaposing a large number of matrices, and demonstrate its effectiveness in analyzing multi-faceted, time-varying networks using real-world data.",

The rich information about the network nodes and links can be represented as multivariate graphs, in which the nodes are accompanied with attributes to represent the properties of individual nodes. An important task often encountered in multivariate network analysis is to uncover link structure with groups, e.g., to understand why a person fits a specific job or certain role in a social group well.The task usually involves complex considerations including specific requirement of node attributes and link structure, and hence a fully automatic solution is typically not satisfactory.In this work, we identify the design challenges for min-ing groups with complex criteria and present an interactive system, g-Miner, that enables visual mining of groups on multivariate graph data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through case study and in-depth expert inter-views. This work contributes to understanding the design of systems for leveraging users knowledge progressively with algorithmic capacity for tackling massive heterogeneous information.",

By identifying and exploring clusters in the design space, we discuss challenges and share perspectives on future research.

Yet real world data is rarely just graph-structured, but instead exhibits multiple facets, such as multivariate attributes, or spatial and temporal frames of reference. In an effort to display different facets of a graph, such a wealth of visualization techniques has been developed in the past that current surveys focus on a single additional facet only in order to enumerate and classify them. This report builds on existing graph visualization surveys for the four common facets of partitions, attributes, time, and space. It contributes a generic high-level categorization of faceted graph visualization that subsumes the existing classifications, which can be understood as facet-specific refinements of the resulting categories. Furthermore, it extends beyond existing surveys by applying the same categorization to graph visualizations with multiple facets. For each of the introduced categories and considered facets, this overview provides visualization examples to illustrate instances of their realization.",

A coherent and comprehensive review of the vast research activity concerning epidemic processes is presented, detailing the successful theoretical approaches as well as making their limits and assumptions clear. Physicists, mathematicians, epidemiologists, computer, and social scientists share a common interest in studying epidemic spreading and rely on similar models for the description of the diffusion of pathogens, knowledge, and innovation. For this reason, while focusing on the main results and the paradigmatic models in infectious disease modeling, the major results concerning generalized social contagion processes are also presented. Finally, the research activity at the forefront in the study of epidemic spreading in coevolving, coupled, and time-varying networks is reported.",

This paper presents OnionGraph, an integrated framework for exploratory visual analysis of large heterogeneous networks. OnionGraph allows nodes to be aggregated based on either node attributes, topology, or a mixture of both. Subsets of nodes can be flexibly split and merged under the hierarchical focus+context interaction model, supporting sophisticated analysis of the network data. Node aggregations that contain subsets of nodes are displayed with multiple concentric circles, or the onion metaphor, indicating how many levels of abstraction they contain. We have evaluated the OnionGraph tool in two real-world cases. Performance experiments demonstrate that on a commodity desktop, OnionGraph can scale to million-node networks while preserving the interactivity for analysis.",

Multilayer networks appear naturally in real data as, in many cases, the relationships (links) between the elements (nodes) can be of different kinds. For example, people can be connected through friendship, family relations, or work relations. This structure can be represented as a network formed by three layers, one for each type of relationship, with the same nodes repeated in all layers. Thus, there are different behaviors in each layer, and interactions between them, which result in more realistic but, at the same time, more complex dynamics. This chapter shows how interconnected multilayer topology describes such networks more accurately than edge coloring does and introduces the tensor formalism used to construct them.",

Recently interacting and multiplex networks are attracting great attention because their dynamics and robustness cannot be understood without treating at the same time several networks. Here we present maximal entropy ensembles of spatial multiplex and spatial interacting networks that can be used in order to model spatial multilayer network structures and to build null models of real data sets. We show that spatial multiplexes naturally develop a significant overlap of the links, a noticeable property of many multiplexes that can affect significantly the dynamics taking place on them. Additionally, we characterize ensembles of spatial interacting networks and we analyze the structure of interacting airport and railway networks in India, showing the effect of space in determining the link probability.",

All such systems are better described in terms of multiplex networks, where the links at each layer represent a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes rather than in terms of (single-layer) networks. In this paper we present a general framework to describe and study multiplex networks, whose links are either unweighted or weighted. In particular, we propose a series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity of the systems in terms of (i) basic node and link properties such as the node degree, and the edge overlap and reinforcement, (ii) local properties such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity, and (iii) global properties related to the navigability of the multiplex across the different layers. The measures we introduce are validated on a genuinely multiplex data set of Indonesian terrorists, where information among 78 individuals are recorded with respect to mutual trust, common operations, exchanged communications, and business relationships.",

For example, social scientists may want to investigate asymmetric relations in organizations with strict chains of command, or incorporate non-actors such as conferences and projects when analyzing coauthorship patterns. Multimodal social networks are those where actors and relations belong to different types, or modes, and multimodal social network analysis (mSNA) is accordingly SNA for such networks. In this paper, we present a design study that we conducted with several social scientist collaborators on how to support mSNA using visual analytics tools. Based on an openended, formative design process, we devised a visual representation called parallel node-link bands (PNLBs) that splits modes into separate bands and renders connections between adjacent ones, similar to the list view in Jigsaw. We then used the tool in a qualitative evaluation involving five social scientists whose feedback informed a second design phase that incorporated additional network metrics. Finally, we conducted a second qualitative evaluation with our social scientist collaborators that provided further insights on the utility of the PNLBs representation and the potential of visual analytics for mSNA.",

We want to understand the relationships between dimensions of data, but lack flexible techniques for exploration beyond low-order relationships. Current visual techniques for multidimensional data analysis focus on binary conjunctive relationships between dimensions. Recent techniques, such as cross-filtering on an attribute relationship graph, facilitate the exploration of some higher-order conjunctive relationships, but require a great deal of care and precision to do so effectively. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the expressive power of existing visual querying systems and describes a more flexible approach in which users can explore n-ary conjunctive inter- and intra- dimensional relationships by interactively constructing queries as visual hypergraphs. In a hypergraph query, nodes represent subsets of values and hyperedges represent conjunctive relationships. Analysts can dynamically build and modify the query using sequences of simple interactions. The hypergraph serves not only as a query specification, but also as a compact visual representation of the interactive state. Using examples from several domains, focusing on the digital humanities, we describe the design considerations for developing the querying system and incorporating it into visual analysis tools. We analyze query expressiveness with regard to the kinds of questions it can and cannot pose, and describe how it simultaneously expands the expressiveness of and is complemented by cross-filtering.",

With a growing number of entities, the resulting element-set membership matrix becomes very rich of information about how these sets overlap. Many analysis tasks targeted at set-typed data are concerned with these overlaps as salient features of such data. This paper presents Radial Sets, a novel visual technique to analyze set memberships for a large number of elements. Our technique uses frequency-based representations to enable quickly finding and analyzing different kinds of overlaps between the sets, and relating these overlaps to other attributes of the table entities. Furthermore, it enables various interactions to select elements of interest, find out if they are over-represented in specific sets or overlaps, and if they exhibit a different distribution for a specific attribute compared to the rest of the elements. These interactions allow formulating highly-expressive visual queries on the elements in terms of their set memberships and attribute values. As we demonstrate via two usage scenarios, Radial Sets enable revealing and analyzing a multitude of overlapping patterns between large sets, beyond the limits of state-of-the-art techniques.",

This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and flexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-specific problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our typology and over two dozen extant classification systems and theoretical frameworks from the literatures of visualization, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, communications, and cartography.",

However, due to combined challenges in scale, density, and heterogeneity, it is impractical for users to answer many interesting questions by visual inspection alone. This is because even a semantically simple question, such as which of my extended friends are also fans of my favorite band, can in fact require information from a non-trivial number of nodes to answer. In this paper, we propose a method that combines graph browsing with query to overcome the limitation of visual inspection. By using query as the main way for information discovery in graph exploration, our query, expand, and query again model enables users to probe beyond the visible part of the graph and only bring in the interesting nodes, leaving the view clutter-free. We have implemented a prototype called GraphCharter and demonstrated its effectiveness and usability in a case study and a user study on Freebase knowledge graph with millions of nodes and edges.",

Follow-up initiatives are revealing thousands of interrelationships between gene products that need to be analyzed with novel bioinformatics approaches able to capture their complex emerging properties. Recently, we developed NetAligner, a novel network alignment tool that allows the identification of conserved protein complexes and pathways across organisms, providing valuable hints as to how those interaction networks evolved. NetAligner includes the prediction of likely conserved interactions, based on evolutionary distances, to counter the high number of missing interactions in current interactome networks, and a fast assessment of the statistical significance of individual alignment solutions, which increases its performance with respect to existing tools. The web server implementation of the NetAligner algorithm presented here features complex, pathway and interactome to interactome alignments for seven model organisms, namely Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. The user can query complexes and pathways of arbitrary topology against a target species interactome, or directly compare two complete interactomes to identify conserved complexes and subnetworks. Alignment solutions can be downloaded or directly visualized in the browser. The NetAligner web server is publicly available at http://netaligner.irbbarcelona.org/.",

We contribute a novel saliency measure for selecting relevant terms and a seriation algorithm that both reveals clustering structure and promotes the legibility of related terms. In a series of examples, we demonstrate how Termite allows analysts to identify coherent and significant themes.",

In this article, we review the challenges and opportunities associated with addressing data quality issues. We argue that analysts might more effectively wrangle data through new interactive systems that integrate data verification, transformation, and visualization. We identify a number of outstanding research questions, including how appropriate visual encodings can facilitate apprehension of missing data, discrepant values, and uncertainty; how interactive visualizations might facilitate data transform specification; and how recorded provenance and social interaction might enable wider reuse, verification, and modification of data transformations.",

Effective visual analysis of graphs requires appropriate visual presentations in combination with respective user interaction facilities and algorithmic graph analysis methods. How to design appropriate graph analysis systems depends on many factors, including the type of graph describing the data, the analytical task at hand and the applicability of graph analysis methods. The most recent surveys of graph visualization and navigation techniques cover techniques that had been introduced until 2000 or concentrate only on graph layouts published until 2002. Recently, new techniques have been developed covering a broader range of graph types, such as timevarying graphs. Also, in accordance with ever growing amounts of graphstructured data becoming available, the inclusion of algorithmic graph analysis and interaction techniques becomes increasingly important. In this StateoftheArt Report, we survey available techniques for the visual analysis of large graphs. Our review first considers graph visualization techniques according to the type of graphs supported. The visualization techniques form the basis for the presentation of interaction approaches suitable for visual graph exploration. As an important component of visual graph analysis, we discuss various graph algorithmic aspects useful for the different stages of the visual graph analysis process. We also present main open research challenges in this field.",

In this paper, we present three novel approaches for achieving a tighter integration of these views through hybrid techniques for multidimensional visualization, graph selection and layout. First, we present the FlowVizMenu, a radial menu containing a scatterplot that can be popped up transiently and manipulated with rapid, fluid gestures to select and modify the axes of its scatterplot. Second, the FlowVizMenu can be used to steer an attribute-driven layout of the network, causing certain nodes of a node-link diagram to move toward their corresponding positions in a scatterplot while others can be positioned manually or by force-directed layout. Third, we describe a novel hybrid approach that combines a scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) and parallel coordinates called the Parallel Scatterplot Matrix (P-SPLOM), which can be used to visualize and select features within the network. We also describe a novel arrangement of scatterplots called the Scatterplot Staircase (SPLOS) that requires less space than a traditional scatterplot matrix. Initial user feedback is reported.",

However, there is a lack of effective analysis tools that reveal the multifaceted relations of documents within or cross the document clusters.

FacetAtlas combines search technology with advanced visual analytical tools to convey both global and local patterns simultaneously. We describe several unique aspects of FacetAtlas, including (1) node cliques and multifaceted edges, (2) an optimized density map, and (3) automated opacity pattern enhancement for highlighting visual patterns, (4) interactive context switch between facets. In addition, we demonstrate the power of FacetAtlas through a case study that targets patient education in the health care domain.

The metabolites are interconnected through metabolic reactions, generally grouped into metabolic pathways. Classical metabolic maps provide a relational context to help interpret metabolomics experiments and a wide range of tools have been developed to help place metabolites within metabolic pathways. However, the representation of metabolites within separate disconnected pathways overlooks most of the connectivity of the metabolome. By definition, reference pathways cannot integrate novel pathways nor show relationships between metabolites that may be linked by common neighbours without being considered as joint members of a classical biochemical pathway. MetExplore is a web server that offers the possibility to link metabolites identified in untargeted metabolomics experiments within the context of genome-scale reconstructed metabolic networks. The analysis pipeline comprises mapping metabolomics data onto the specific metabolic network of an organism, then applying graph-based methods and advanced visualization tools to enhance data analysis.

Cell visualizations and interactive column overviews allow analysts to assess the distribution of attributes within particular sets of networks.

The output from a level above is input to the level below, bringing attention to the design challenge that an upstream error inevitably cascades to all downstream levels. This model provides prescriptive guidance for determining appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying threats to validity unique to each level. We also provide three recommendations motivated by this model: authors should distinguish between these levels when claiming contributions at more than one of them, authors should explicitly state upstream assumptions at levels above the focus of a paper, and visualization venues should accept more papers on domain characterization.",

MMNs generalize the standard notions of graphs and hypergraphs, which are the bases of current diagrammatic representations of biological phenomena and incorporate the concept of mode. Each vertex of an MMN is a biological entity, a biot, while each modal hyperedge is a typed relationship, where the type is given by the mode of the hyperedge. The current paper defines MMNs and concentrates on the structural aspects of MMNs. A companion paper develops MMNs as a representation of the semantics of biological networks and discusses applications of the MMNs in managing complex biological data.

Elements that are unique to each hierarchy are shown, as well as the way in which hierarchy elements are relocated, split or joined. The relations between hierarchy elements are visualized using Hierarchical Edge Bundles (HEBs). HEBs reduce visual clutter, they visually emphasize the aforementioned splits, joins, and relocations of subhierarchies, and they provide an intuitive way in which users can interact with the relations. The focus throughout this paper is on the comparison of different versions of hierarchically organized software systems, but the technique is applicable to other kinds of hierarchical data as well. Various data sets of actual software systems are used to show how our technique can be employed to easily spot splits, joins, and relocations of elements, how sorting both hierarchies with respect to each other facilitates comparison tasks, and how user interaction is supported.",

However, prior studies were carried out using displays that provided a level of detail far short of what the human visual system is capable of resolving. Therefore, we undertook a graph comprehension study using a very high resolution stereoscopic display. In our first experiment, we examined the effect of stereoscopic display, kinetic depth, and using 3D tubes versus lines to display the links. The results showed a much greater benefit for 3D viewing than previous studies. For example, with both motion and stereoscopic depth cues, unskilled observers could see paths between nodes in 333 node graphs with less than a 10% error rate. Skilled observers could see up to a 1000-node graph with less than a 10% error rate. This represented an order of magnitude increase over 2D display. In our second experiment, we varied both nodes and links to understand the constraints on the number of links and the size of graph that can be reliably traced. We found the difference between number of links and number of nodes to best account for error rates and suggest that this is evidence for a perceptual phase transition. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for information display.",

Real social behaviour can be understood both to take place on, and to bring about, a complex set of overlapping topologies best described by a multilayer network in which different layers indicate different modes of interaction. Here we distinguish between the milieu within which social organisation is embedded and the transactional relationships that constitute this social organisation. While both can be represented by network structures, their topologies will not necessarily be the same. Researchers in various domains have realised the importance of the context in which individuals are embedded in shaping properties of the functional transactions in which they choose to engage. We review several examples of the relationship between milieu and function and propose a conceptual framework that may help advance our understanding of how social organisation can occur as a result of self-organisation and adaptation.",

It uncovers the invisible relationships between actors in a network and provides understanding of social processes and behaviors. It has become an important technique in a variety of application areas such as the Web, organizational studies, and homeland security. This paper presents a visual analytics tool, OntoVis, for understanding large, heterogeneous social networks, in which nodes and links could represent different concepts and relations, respectively. These concepts and relations are related through an ontology (also known as a schema). OntoVis is named such because it uses information in the ontology associated with a social network to semantically prune a large, heterogeneous network. In addition to semantic abstraction, OntoVis also allows users to do structural abstraction and importance filtering to make large networks manageable and to facilitate analytic reasoning. All these unique capabilities of OntoVis are illustrated with several case studies",

FacetMap uses a visual metaphor for both input (selection of metadata facets as filters) and output. Results of a user study provide insight into tradeoffs between FacetMaps graphical approach and the traditional text-oriented approach",

The authors divide network movies into (1) static flip books, where node position remains constant but edges cumulate over time, and (2) dynamic movies, where nodes move as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly useful in contexts where relations are sparse. For more connected networks, movies are often more appropriate. Three empirical examples demonstrate the advantages of different movie styles. A new software program for creating network movies is discussed in the appendix.",

Here R (1) is the correlation matrix of the original proximity matrix D and R (n) is the correlation matrix of R (n1) , n> 1. This sequence was first introduced by McQuitty (1968), Breiger, Boorman and Arabie (1975) developed an algorithm, CONCOR, based on their rediscovery of its convergence. The sequence R often converges to a matrix R () whose elements are +1 or 1. This special pattern of R () partitions the p objects into two disjoint groups and so can be recursively applied to generate a divisive hierarchical clustering tree. While convergence is itself useful, we are more concerned with what happens before convergence. Prior to convergence, we note a rank reduction property with elliptical structure: when the rank of R (n) reaches two, the column vectors of R (n) fall on an ellipse in a two-dimensional subspace. The unique order of relative positions for the p points on the ellipse can be used to solve seriation problems such as the reordering of a Robinson matrix. A software package, Generalized Association Plots (GAP), is developed which utilizes computer graphics to retrieve important information hidden in the data or proximity matrices.",

While much excitement has been generated, divergent views, perspectives, and expectations have also raised the serious question : is it a fad or does it have enduring qualities that will herald a new intellectual enterprise? This presentations purpose is to review social capital as discussed in the literature, identify controversies and debates, consider some critical issues, and propose conceptual and research strategies in building a theory. I will argue that such a theory and the research enterprise must be based on the fundamental understanding that social capital is captured from embedded resources in social networks . Deviations from this understanding in conceptualization and measurement lead to confusion in analyzing causal mechanisms in the macroand microprocesses. It is precisely these mechanisms and processes, essential for an interactive theory about structure and action, to which social capital promises to make contributions .",

Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.",

                  "abstract": "Multiplexity is the overlap of roles, exchanges, or affiliations in a social relationship. In two cities, adult friendship dyads are examined for multiplexity in three affiliations: kin, neighbor, and coworker. Several factors are proposed to account for multiplex ties: limited opportunities for social contact; preference for the special similarities that kin, neighbors, and coworkers have; and preference for holistic and diffuse friendships. Two structural features are discovered: repetition of multiplexity, and segregation of affiliations. These mean that if multiplexity appears in one friendship, it tends to be repeated in others. But the categories kin, neighbor, and coworker seldom appear in the same friendship. Repetition and segregation are demonstrated by comparing observed friendships with expectations from a random-choice model. When social and demographic differentials in multiplexity are examined, they confirm the importance of both opportunities and preferences in motivating multiplex friendships. Consequences of multiplexity for friendship behavior are hypothesized, and one consequence (contact frequency) is analyzed. Neighbor multiplexity increases friendship contact, a reflection of high opportunities for contact among neighbor friends. Kin and coworker multiplexity do not increase friendship contact. When adults develop close friendships, they sometimes select their friends from among kin, neighbors, and coworkers. In social networks research, this overlap of two or more important social relationships is called multiplexity. Although some studies report the frequency of such overlap, no study has seriously examined the structure and importance of multiplexity in adult friendships. Does multiplexity occur throughout a persons friendship network? In other words, if one close friend is a relative, are other close friends also relatives? Are friendships often highly multiplex, for example, kin friends who are coworkers or neighbors as well? What encourages people to develop multiplex friendships, and what consequences does multiplexity have for the stability and energy of friendships? This paper concentrates on the structure of multiplexity and its causes in adult friendships in two urban populations, with less attention to",

MultiPiles is based on the physical analogy of piling adjacency matrices, each one representing a single temporal snapshot. Common interfaces for visualizing dynamic networks use techniques such as: flipping/animation; small multiples; or summary views in isolation. Our proposed piling metaphor presents a hybrid of these techniques, leveraging each ones advantages, as well as offering the ability to scale to networks with hundreds of temporal snapshots. While the MultiPiles technique is applicable to many domains, our prototype was initially designed to help neuroscientists investigate changes in brain connectivity networks over several hundred snapshots. The piling metaphor and associated interaction and visual encodings allowed neuroscientists to explore their data, prior to a statistical analysis. They detected highlevel temporal patterns in individual networks and this helped them to formulate and reject several hypotheses.",

Two studies are reported which suggest that, while certain aspects of attention require that locations be scanned serially, at least one operation may be carried out in parallel across several independent loci in the visual field. That is the operation of indexing features and tracking their identity. The studies show that: (a) subjects are able to track a subset of up to 5 objects in a field of 10 identical randomly-moving objects in order to distinguish a change in a target from a change in a distractor; and (b) when the speed and distance parameters of the display are designed so that, on the basis of some very conservative assumptions about the speed of attention movement and encoding times, the predicted performance of a serial scanning and updating algorithm would not exceed about 40% accuracy, subjects still manage to do the task with 87% accuracy. These findings are discussed in relation to an earlier, and independently motivated model of feature-binding--called the FINST model--which posits a primitive identity maintenance mechanism that indexes and tracks a limited number of visual objects in parallel. These indexes are hypothesized to serve the function of binding visual features prior to subsequent pattern recognition.",

Our analysis of research topics in visualization can, thus, serve as a starting point to (a) help create a common vocabulary to improve communication among different visualization sub-groups, (b) facilitate the process of understanding differences and commonalities of the various research sub-fields in visualization, (c) provide an understanding of emerging new research trends, (d) facilitate the crucial step of finding the right reviewers for research submissions, and (e) it can eventually lead to a comprehensive taxonomy of visualization research.

It thus creates a special type of time-dependent network. Such processes are studied in various applications, for example, in financial network analysis, infection diffusion prediction, supply-chain management, or gene regulation. Visual analytics methods can help analysts examine contagion effects. For this purpose, network visualizations need to be complemented with specific features to illustrate the contagion process. Moreover, new visual analysis techniques for comparison of contagion need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a system geared to the visual analysis of contagion. It includes the simulation of contagion effects as well as their visual exploration. We present new tools able to compare the evolution of the different contagion processes. In this way, propagation of disturbances can be effectively analyzed. We focus on financial networks; however, our system can be applied to other use cases as well.",

Existing solutions are usually good for overview and presentation tasks, but not for the interactive analysis of a large dynamic network. We introduce in this paper a new approach which considers only the dynamic network central to a focus node, also known as the egocentric dynamic network. Our major contribution is a novel 1.5D visualization design which greatly reduces the visual complexity of the dynamic network without sacrificing the topological and temporal context central to the focus node. In our design, the egocentric dynamic network is presented in a single static view, supporting rich analysis through user interactions on both time and network. We propose a general framework for the 1.5D visualization approach, including the data processing pipeline, the visualization algorithm design, and customized interaction methods. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on egocentric dynamic network analysis tasks, through case studies and a controlled user experiment comparing with three baseline dynamic network visualization methods.",

To support this analytic need, we introduce a novel temporal search and replace tool (TSR) implemented in our existing EventFlow visual analytic system to facilitate visual-language-based search and replacement of temporal event sequences. We also introduce two types of search constraints: repetition and permutation that integrate regular expression concepts into temporal event sequence searching.

The traditional method of searching for such patterns uses an automaton-based approach over a single array of events, sorted by time stamps. Instead, TPS operates on a set of arrays, where each array contains all events of the same type, sorted by time stamps. TPS searches for a particular item in the pattern using a binary search over the appropriate arrays. Although binary search is considerably more expensive per item, it allows TPS to skip many unnecessary events in personal histories. We show that TPSs running time is bounded by O(m2n lg(n)), where m is the length of (number of events) a search pattern, and n is the number of events in a record (history). Although the asymptotic running time of TPS is inferior to that of a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) approach (O(mn)), TPS performs better than NFA under our experimental conditions. We also show TPS is very competitive with Shift-And, a bit-parallel approach, with real data. Since the experimental conditions we describe here subsume the conditions under which analysts would typically use TPS (i.e., within an interactive visualization program), we argue that TPS is an appropriate design choice for us.",

Current approaches to solving the stress model for a graph with || nodes and || edges require the full allpairs shortest paths (APSP) matrix, which takes O(||2 log ||+||) time and O(||2) space. We propose a novel algorithm based on a lowrank approximation to the required matrices. The crux of our technique is an observation that it is possible to approximate the full APSP matrix, even when only a small subset of its entries are known. Our algorithm takes time O(k||+||log||+||) per iteration with a preprocessing time of O(k3+ k(||+|| log ||) + k2||) and memory usage of O(k||), where a userdefined parameter k trades off quality of approximation with running time and space. We give experimental results which show, to the best of our knowledge, the largest (albeit approximate) full stress model based layouts to date.",

With the existing techniques, rendering such plots becomes prohibitively slow, especially for large scientific datasets. This paper presents a scalable and progressive rendering algorithm for continuous data plots that allows exploratory analysis of large datasets at interactive framerates. The algorithm employs splatting to produce a series of plots that are combined using alpha blending to achieve a progressively improving image. For each individual frame, splats are obtained by transforming Gaussian density kernels from the 3D domain of the input dataset to the respective data domain. A closedform analytic description of the resulting splat footprints is derived to allow precomputation of splat textures for efficient GPU rendering. The plotting method is versatile because it supports arbitrary reconstruction or interpolation schemes for the input data and the splatting technique is scalable because it chooses splat samples independently from the size of the input dataset. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is compared to existing techniques regarding rendering performance and quality.",

Such labeling often exists in many application areas: IP addresses in computer networks, namespaces, class names, and function names in software engineering, to name a few. As many areas of the graph may be the same in both graphs, we visualize large areas of difference through a graph hierarchy. We introduce a path-preserving coarsening technique for degree one nodes of the same classification.

The authors argue that the process of technological adaptation is not gradual and continuous, as often argued in the innovation literature, but is instead highly discontinuous. Evidence from three manufacturing and service organizations indicates that there exists a relatively brief window of opportunity to explore and modify new process technology following initial implementation. Afterwards, modification of new process technologies by users is limited by the increasing routinization that occurs with experience. Thus, the technology and its context of use tend to congeal, often embedding unresolved problems into organizational practice. Subsequent changes appear to occur in an episodic manner, triggered either by discrepant events or by new discoveries on the part of users. These findings have important implications for theories of technological change.",

The algorithm, whose goal is to compute layouts accurately and quickly, has two contributions.

Since the GPU requires a data parallel programming model, the challenge is devising a mapping of a naturally unstructured graph into a well-partitioned structured one. This is done by computing a balanced partitioning of a general graph. This algorithm provides a general multi-level scheme, which has the potential to be used not only for computation on the GPU, but also on emerging multi-core architectures.

An important first step, before analysis can begin, is ensuring that the data is accurate. A common data quality problem is that the data may inadvertently contain several distinct references to the same underlying entity; the process of reconciling these references is called entity-resolution. D-Dupe is an interactive tool that combines data mining algorithms for entity resolution with a task-specific network visualization. Users cope with complexity of cleaning large networks by focusing on a small subnetwork containing a potential duplicate pair. The subnetwork highlights relationships in the social network, making the common relationships easy to visually identify. D-Dupe users resolve ambiguities either by merging nodes or by marking them distinct. The entity resolution process is iterative: as pairs of nodes are resolved, additional duplicates may be revealed; therefore, resolution decisions are often chained together. We give examples of how users can flexibly apply sequences of actions to produce a high quality entity resolution result. We illustrate and evaluate the benefits of D-Dupe on three bibliographic collections. Two of the datasets had already been cleaned, and therefore should not have contained duplicates; despite this fact, many duplicates were rapidly identified using D-Dupes unique combination of entity resolution algorithms within a task-specific visual interface",

ACE exhibits an improvement of something like two orders of magnitude over the fastest algorithms we are aware of; it draws graphs of millions of nodes in less than a minute. ACE finds an optimal drawing by minimizing a quadratic energy function. The minimization problem is expressed as a generalized eigenvalue problem, which is rapidly solved using a novel algebraic multigrid technique. The same generalized eigenvalue problem seems to come up also in other fields, hence ACE appears to be applicable outside of graph drawing too.",

Stefinia was a participant in a classroom-based study that explored how developing students knowledge of literary and illustrative elements affects their understanding, interpretation, and analysis of picturebooks and graphic novels, and the subsequent creation of their own print, multimodal texts. As well as being informed by narrative theory and metafiction, the research was framed by an ecological perspective on teaching and learning in classrooms. During a 10-week period, Stefinia participated in interdependent activities that offered her opportunities to learn about metafictive devices, some art elements, and a few compositional principles of graphic novels. Stefinia read and wrote responses to several picturebooks and four graphic novels; engaged in small group, peer-led discussions about the literature; and received explicit instruction about particular literary, illustrative, and compositional devices and techniques. She had the opportunity to apply and represent her learning by creating her own multimodal print text as the culminating activity of the study. The content analysis of Stefinias written and illustrative text focuses on her use of various metafictive devices that disrupted narrative structures or ontological boundaries in her multimodal book. The findings reveal how Stefinias participation and engagement in a particular classroom community of practice affected her learning of the content and concepts under study.",

We design two experiments in which participants are asked to search for the names of point features on maps and to rate the map complexity and legibility for different label densities. Specifically, we conduct a highly controlled experiment in which all the map variables except the label density are held constant (the controlled experiment). Then, we conduct a second experiment following the same protocol but using real maps as visual stimuli (the real-map experiment) to verify if the results of the controlled experiment were applicable to real maps. The results of both experiments indicate a significantly positive correlation between perceived visual complexity and label density and between the response time in visual search tasks and label density. Surprisingly, we observe a significant inverse correlation between the label density and two eye movement parameters (fixation duration and fixation frequency) between the two experiments. We discuss how the variables of real maps might have affected these eye movement parameters and why the results of the two experiments are inconsistent. Our findings suggest that eye tracking parameters are not reliable indicators of map complexity. These empirical results can be helpful to future map design and map complexity investigation.",

Interactive flow mapping applications allow users to explore large movement datasets by automatically generating flow maps from subsets of the data in response to queries by the user. However, even a small number of flows can overlap and cross each other in a way that impedes accurate interpretation. We introduce an interactive flow map of migration in the United States from 2009 to 2013 that uses a force-directed method to automatically lay out migration flows at the county-to-county and state levels. This map, available at http://usmigrationflowmapper.com/, aims at improving readability by automatically creating origindestination flow layouts according to identified cartographic design principles. Map users explore high-level state-to-state migration patterns as well as detailed county-to-county movements through a custom user interface and interactive map features. We show migration flows between counties of different states by representing other states as nodes with a circular arrangement around the selected state, and connect county flows to those nodes. This constrains the map layout to a smaller area, reducing clutter and the amount of interaction required to view flows.",

To support such an analysis, we combine the analysis steps of frequent quantitative and text-oriented data using an existing a priori method. First, based on heuristics, we extract interesting intervals and patterns in large time series data. The visual analysis supports the analyst in exploring parameter combinations and their results. The identified time series patterns are then input for the second analysis step, in which all identified intervals of interest are analyzed for frequent patterns co-occurring with financial news. An a priori method supports the discovery of such sequential temporal patterns. Then, various text features such as the degree of sentence nesting, noun phrase complexity, and the vocabulary richness, are extracted from the news items to obtain meta-patterns. Meta-patterns are defined by a specific combination of text features which significantly differ from the text features of the remaining news data. Our approach combines a portfolio of visualization and analysis techniques, including time, cluster, and sequence visualization and analysis functionality. We provide a case study and an evaluation on financial data where we identify important future work. The workflow could be generalized to other application domains such as data analysis of smart grids, cyber physical systems, or the security of critical infrastructure, where the data consist of a combination of quantitative and textual time series data.",

This work seeks to provide a theoretical framework for how to design controllers that are decomposed across timescales in this way. The framework is analogous to how the network utility maximization framework uses optimization decomposition to distribute a global control problem across independent controllers, each of which solves a local problem; except our goal is to decompose a global problem temporally, extracting a timescale separation. Our results highlight that decomposition of a multi-timescale controller into a fast timescale, reactive controller and a slow timescale, predictive controller can be near-optimal in a strong sense.

A number of AI techniques have proven effective in fraud detection; however break detection systems address more complex problems than have typically been reported. Problems addressed by break detection systems are characterized not only by dynamic data with complicated temporal and other relationships, but also by changing types of fraudulent behavior. Furthermore, the available data usually does not provide the appropriate representation for direct search. In particular, we note the essential role of consolidation and linkage in these systems to build abstractions that can support break detection. The authors have had experience designing and building two break detection systems in related domains of financial transactions - one to discover occurrences of money laundering involving large cash transactions reported to the U.S. Treasury, the other to discover potentially violative behavior of stock broker/dealers in the Nasdaq Stock Market. We discuss problem domain characteristics, AI techniques, and lessons learned about break detection in the context of the architectures of these systems.",

The demands of statistical objectivity make it highly desirable to base the choice on properties of the data set. In this article we introduce some biased cross-validation criteria for selection of smoothing parameters for kernel and histogram density estimators, closely related to one investigated in Scott and Factor (1981). These criteria are obtained by estimating L 2 norms of derivatives of the unknown density and provide slightly biased estimates of the average squared L 2 error or mean integrated squared error. These criteria are roughly the analog of Wahbas (1981) generalized cross-validation procedure for orthogonal series density estimators. We present the relationship of the biased cross-validation procedure to the least squares cross-validation procedure, which provides unbiased estimates of the mean integrated squared error. Both methods are shown to be based on U statistics. We compare the two metho...",

SentenTree displays a node-link diagram where nodes are words and links indicate word co-occurrence within the same sentence. The spatial arrangement of nodes gives cues to the syntactic ordering of words while the size of nodes gives cues to their frequency of occurrence.

Second, the paper [1] is riddled with issues specific to a variety of influence maximization algorithms, including buggy experiments, and draws many misleading conclusions regarding those algorithms.

To achieve such scale, our solution leverages the vertex-centric Pregel abstraction provided by Giraph, a system for large-scale graph analytics. We designed our algorithm to compute partitions with high locality and fair balance, and focused on the characteristics necessary to reach wide adoption by practitioners in production. Our solution can (i) scale to massive graphs and thousands of compute cores, (ii) efficiently adapt partitions to changes to graphs and compute environments, and (iii) seamlessly integrate in existing systems without additional infrastructure. We evaluate our solution on the Facebook and Instagram graphs, as well as on other large-scale, real-world graphs. We show that it is scalable and computes partitionings with quality comparable, and sometimes outperforming, existing solutions. By integrating the computed partitionings in Giraph, we speedup various real-world applications by up to a factor of 5.6 compared to default hash-partitioning.",

                  "abstract": "Analyzing large textual collections has become increasingly challenging given the size of the data available and the rate that more data is being generated. Topic-based text summarization methods coupled with interactive visualizations have presented promising approaches to address the challenge of analyzing large text corpora. As the text corpora and vocabulary grow larger, more topics need to be generated in order to capture the meaningful latent themes and nuances in the corpora. However, it is difficult for most of current topic-based visualizations to represent large number of topics without being cluttered or illegible. To facilitate the representation and navigation of a large number of topics, we propose a visual analytics system - HierarchicalTopic (HT). HT integrates a computational algorithm, Topic Rose Tree, with an interactive visual interface. The Topic Rose Tree constructs a topic hierarchy based on a list of topics. The interactive visual interface is designed to present the topic content as well as temporal evolution of topics in a hierarchical fashion. User interactions are provided for users to make changes to the topic hierarchy based on their mental model of the topic space. To qualitatively evaluate HT, we present a case study that showcases how HierarchicalTopics aid expert users in making sense of a large number of topics and discovering interesting patterns of topic groups. We have also conducted a user study to quantitatively evaluate the effect of hierarchical topic structure. The study results reveal that the HT leads to faster identification of large number of relevant topics. We have also solicited user feedback during the experiments and incorporated some suggestions into the current version of HierarchicalTopics.",

Conventional-term-frequency-based approaches may not be appropriate in this context, because the information exchanged in social-network posts include not only text but also images, URLs, and videos. We focus on emergence of topics signaled by social aspects of theses networks. Specifically, we focus on mentions of users--links between users that are generated dynamically (intentionally or unintentionally) through replies, mentions, and retweets. We propose a probability model of the mentioning behavior of a social network user, and propose to detect the emergence of a new topic from the anomalies measured through the model. Aggregating anomaly scores from hundreds of users, we show that we can detect emerging topics only based on the reply/mention relationships in social-network posts. We demonstrate our technique in several real data sets we gathered from Twitter. The experiments show that the proposed mention-anomaly-based approaches can detect new topics at least as early as text-anomaly-based approaches, and in some cases much earlier when the topic is poorly identified by the textual contents in posts.",

Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g., circles on Google+, and lists on Facebook and Twitter). However, circles are laborious to construct and must be manually updated whenever a users network grows. In this article, we study the novel task of automatically identifying users social circles. We pose this task as a multimembership node clustering problem on a users ego network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information. For each circle, we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles.

In order to determine whether or not natural user behaviors have a real effect on the locatability of users, we performed a simple machine learning experiment to determine whether we can identify a users location by only looking at what that user tweets. We found that a users country and state can in fact be determined easily with decent accuracy, indicating that users implicitly reveal location information, with or without realizing it. Implications for location-based services and privacy are discussed.",

For example, the colleagues have strong influence on ones work, while the friends have strong influence on ones daily life. How to differentiate the social influences from different angles(topics)? How to quantify the strength of those social influences? How to estimate the model on real large networks? To address these fundamental questions, we propose Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) to model the topic-level social influence on large networks. In particular, TAP can take results of any topic modeling and the existing network structure to perform topic-level influence propagation. With the help of the influence analysis, we present several important applications on real data sets such as 1) what are the representative nodes on a given topic? 2) how to identify the social influences of neighboring nodes on a particular node? To scale to real large networks, TAP is designed with efficient distributed learning algorithms that is implemented and tested under the Map-Reduce framework. We further present the common characteristics of distributed learning algorithms for Map-Reduce. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TAP on real large data sets.",

Our goal is to find a small set S of nodes such that targeting the product to S would lead to adoption of the product by a large number of nodes in the graph. We show strong inapproximability results for several variants of this problem. Our main result says that the problem of minimizing the size of S, while ensuring that targeting S would influence the whole network into adopting the product, is hard to approximate within a polylogarithmic factor. This implies similar results if only a fixed fraction of the network is ensured to adopt the product. Further, the hardness of approximation result continues to hold when all nodes have majority thresholds, or have constant degree and threshold two. The latter answers a complexity question proposed in [10, 29]. We also give some positive results for more restricted cases, such as when the underlying graph is a tree.",

The NodeTrix representation consisting of adjacency matrices and node-link diagrams has been popularly used in social network analysis. Different from previous works on NodeTrix based on square-shaped matrices, the proposed NodeTrix applies triangle-shaped matrices for visualizing overlapping communities to save the displaying space, and a simulated annealing algorithm is used to reduce the crossings among links and communities. In the CPSS for smart factories, working-in-process (WIP) products are categorized according to their attributes, and are placed at different storage locations for later different production processes. By the NodeTrix-based interface for CPSS, when users with different domains and experiences work together to make instant decisions on production and logistics, the physical production environment will be adjusted accordingly and immediately through technological support of Industry 4.0. Through the interface, the information on locations, parameters, and interoperability of WIP products can be visualized and adjusted in time. By comparison with other works, the proposed representation looks promising in displaying social networks for the CPSS with fewer crossings within a smaller screen space.",

The real-time visualization of graphs with millions of edges is a challenge but is necessary to grasp information hidden in huge datasets. This article presents an end-to-end technique to visualize huge graphs using an established Big Data ecosystem and a lightweight client running in a Web browser. For that purpose, levels of abstraction and graph tiles are generated by a batch layer and the interactive visualization is provided using a serving layer and client-side real-time computation of edge bundling and graph splatting. A major challenge is to create techniques that work without moving data to an ad hoc system and that take advantage of the horizontal scalability of these infrastructures. We introduce two novel scalable algorithms that enable to generate a canopy clustering and to aggregate graph edges. These two algorithms are both used to produce levels of abstraction and graph tiles. We prove that our technique guarantee a quality of visualization by controlling both the necessary bandwidth required for data transfer and the quality of the produced visualization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usability of our technique by providing a complete prototype. We present benchmarks on graphs with millions of elements and we compare our results to those obtained by state of the art techniques. Our results show that new Big Data technologies can be incorporated into visualization pipeline to push out the size limits of graphs one can visually analyze.",

As a worldwide emergency response, governments have implemented various measures and policies, such as self-quarantine, travel restrictions, work from home, and regional lockdown, to control the spread of the epidemic. These countermeasures seek to restrict human mobility because COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that is spread by human-to-human transmission. Medical experts and policymakers have expressed the urgency to effectively evaluate the outcome of human restriction policies with the aid of big data and information technology. Thus, based on big human mobility data and city POI data, an interactive visual analytics system called Epidemic Mobility (EpiMob) was designed in this study. The system interactively simulates the changes in human mobility and infection status in response to the implementation of a certain restriction policy or a combination of policies (e.g., regional lockdown, telecommuting, screening). Users can conveniently designate the spatial and temporal ranges for different mobility restriction policies. Then, the results reflecting the infection situation under different policies are dynamically displayed and can be flexibly compared and analyzed in depth. Multiple case studies consisting of interviews with domain experts were conducted in the largest metropolitan area of Japan (i.e., Greater Tokyo Area) to demonstrate that the system can provide insight into the effects of different human mobility restriction policies for epidemic control, through measurements and comparisons.",

Methods We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission. Conclusions During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.)",

Researchers and software developers broadly use it, given that it is fast, cheap and easy to use. Using it in other areas demands creating a new heuristic set able to identify common problems of these areas. Information Visualization (InfoVis) researchers commonly use this technique with the original usability heuristic set proposed by Nielsen, which does not cover many relevant aspects of InfoVis. InfoVis literature presents sets of guidelines that cover InfoVis concepts, but it does not present most of them as heuristics, or they cover much specific concepts. This work presents a method for defining a set of InfoVis heuristics for use in heuristic evaluation. The method clusters heuristics and guidelines found in a literature review, and creates a new heuristic set based on each group. As a result, we created a new set of 15 generic heuristics, from a set of 62 ones, which we hypothesize that will help evaluators to take into account a broad set of visualization aspects during evaluation with possibly less cognitive effort.",

                  "abstract": "In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth of asynchronous online conversations (e.g. blogs), thanks to the rise of social media. Analyzing and gaining insights from such discussions can be quite challenging for a user, especially when the user deals with hundreds of comments that are scattered around multiple different conversations. A promising solution to this problem is to automatically mine the major topics from conversations and organize them into a hierarchical structure. However, the resultant topic hierarchy can be noisy and/or it may not match the users current information needs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop approach that allows the user to revise the topic hierarchy based on her feedback. We incorporate this approach within a visual text analytics system that helps users in analyzing and getting insights from conversations by exploring and revising the topic hierarchy. We evaluated the resulting system with real users in a lab-based study. The results from the user study, when compared to its counterpart that does not support interactive revisions of a hierarchical topic model, provide empirical evidence of the potential utility of our system in terms of both performance and subjective measures. Finally, we summarize generalizable lessons for introducing human-in-the-loop computation within a visual text analytics system.",

Characterizing how false information proliferates on social platforms and why it succeeds in deceiving readers are critical to develop efficient detection algorithms and tools for early detection. A recent surge of research in this area has aimed to address the key issues using methods based on feature engineering, graph mining, and information modeling. Majority of the research has primarily focused on two broad categories of false information: opinion-based (e.g., fake reviews), and fact-based (e.g., false news and hoaxes). Therefore, in this work, we present a comprehensive survey spanning diverse aspects of false information, namely (i) the actors involved in spreading false information, (ii) rationale behind successfully deceiving readers, (iii) quantifying the impact of false information, (iv) measuring its characteristics across different dimensions, and finally, (iv) algorithms developed to detect false information. In doing so, we create a unified framework to describe these recent methods and highlight a number of important directions for future research.",

Since trust is an important part of any social interaction, researchers use such networks to understand the nuances of trust relationships. One of the major requirements in trust applications is identifying the trustworthy actors in these networks. This paper proposes a pair of complementary measures that can be used to measure trust scores of actors in a social network using involvement of social networks. Based on the proposed measures, an iterative matrix convergence algorithm is developed that calculates the trustingness and the trustworthiness of each actor in the network. Trustingness of an actor is defined as the propensity of an actor to trust his neighbors in the network. Trustworthiness, on the other hand, is defined as the willingness of the network to trust an individual actor. The algorithm is proposed based on the idea that a person having higher trustingness score contributes to the trustworthiness of its neighbors to a lower degree. Conversely, a higher trustworthiness score is a result of lots of neighbors linked to the actor having low trustingness scores. The algorithm runs in O(k  |E|) time where k denotes the number of iterations and |E| denotes the number of edges in the network. Moreover, the paper shows that the algorithm converges to a finite value quickly. Finally the proposed scores for trust prediction is implemented for various social networks and is shown that the proposed algorithm performs better (average 5%) than the state of the art trust scoring algorithms. The full version of the paper along with the coding implementation can be found at [3].",

In our approach, we provide analysts with a suite of natural scale templates and methods that enable them to focus and drill down to appropriate geospatial and temporal resolution levels. Our forecasting technique is based on the Seasonal Trend decomposition based on Loess (STL) method, which we apply in a spatiotemporal visual analytics context to provide analysts with predicted levels of future activity.

While retaining the scatter-gather programming model with state stored in the vertices, X-Stream is novel in (i) using an edge-centric rather than a vertex-centric implementation of this model, and (ii) streaming completely unordered edge lists rather than performing random access. This design is motivated by the fact that sequential bandwidth for all storage media (main memory, SSD, and magnetic disk) is substantially larger than random access bandwidth. We demonstrate that a large number of graph algorithms can be expressed using the edge-centric scatter-gather model. The resulting implementations scale well in terms of number of cores, in terms of number of I/O devices, and across different storage media. X-Stream competes favorably with existing systems for graph processing. Besides sequential access, we identify as one of the main contributors to better performance the fact that X-Stream does not need to sort edge lists during preprocessing.",

While behavioural responses to the spread of a disease have often been reported anecdotally, there has been relatively little systematic investigation into how behavioural changes can affect disease dynamics. Mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases are an important tool for investigating and quantifying such effects, not least because the spread of a disease among humans is not amenable to direct experimental study. Here, we review recent efforts to incorporate human behaviour into disease models, and propose that such models can be broadly classified according to the type and source of information which individuals are assumed to base their behaviour on, and according to the assumed effects of such behaviour. We highlight recent advances as well as gaps in our understanding of the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and human behaviour, and suggest what kind of data taking efforts would be helpful in filling these gaps.",

This chapter describes 15 classic examples of such resources limits. The chapter then reviews evidence suggesting that this resource primarily reflects competition for representation, across two types of representation. First, limits on the identification of objects may reflect competition within networks that represent object identity (the ventral visual stream). Second, limits on the selection of multiple locations may reflect competition between selected locations within representations of visual space (the dorsal visual stream). This definition of visual resources provides a parsimonious explanation for many effects in the visual cognition literature, and it makes concrete predictions about manipulations that should affect performance across a wide variety of visual tasks.",

Incoming data contain multiple variables, high signal-to-noise ratio, and a degree of uncertainty, all of which hinder exploration, hypothesis generation/exploration, and decision making. To facilitate the exploration of such data, advanced tool sets are needed that allow the user to interact with their data in a visual environment that provides direct analytic capability for finding data aberrations or hotspots. In this paper, we present a suite of tools designed to facilitate the exploration of spatiotemporal data sets. Our system allows users to search for hotspots in both space and time, combining linked views and interactive filtering to provide users with contextual information about their data and allow the user to develop and explore their hypotheses. Statistical data models and alert detection algorithms are provided to help draw user attention to critical areas. Demographic filtering can then be further applied as hypotheses generated become fine tuned. This paper demonstrates the use of such tools on multiple geospatiotemporal data sets.",

The industrial revolution challenged this compatibility because many individuals worked and lived in inhumane conditions. The technological revolution provides another (less compelling) challenge to this compatibility. Donald A. Normans goal is to help relieve feelings of incompatibility by putting the blame on the poor design of everyday things in our environment rather than on ourselves. When we fail to deal appropriately with our environment of water faucets, doors, and VCRs, we usually blame ourselves. Norman demonstrates that much of the blame should be placed on the designer and, in so doing, illustrates once again that psychology is relevant to our everyday life. Theories developed and tested in the laboratory can be used to rationalize behavioral successes and failures in everyday life. Although the book seeks to show that the incompatibility is due to the environment and not the participant, it does not address the reason that we blame ourselves. Perhaps our psychology might also speak to this issue as well as the other.",

It was shown that a natural greedy strategy can give a good approximate solution to this optimization problem. However, a conventional method under the greedy algorithm needs a large amount of computation, since it estimates the marginal gains for the expected number of nodes influenced by a set of nodes by simulating the random process of each model many times. In this paper, we propose a method of efficiently estimating all those quantities on the basis of bond percolation and graph theory, and apply it to approximately solving the optimization problem under the greedy algorithm. Using real-world large-scale networks including blog networks, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the conventional method, and achieve a large reduction in computational cost.",

This title provides expert knowledge on all facets of todays UML standard, helping developers who are encountering UML on the job for the first time to be more productive. The book begins with a history of UML, from structured design methods of the 60s and 70s to the competing object-oriented design standards that were unified in 1997 to create UML. For the novice, the authors illustrate key diagram types such as class, use case, state machine, activity, and implementation. (Of course, learning these basic diagram types is what UML is all about. The authors use an easy-to-understand ticket-booking system for many of their examples.) After a tour of basic document types, The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual provides an alphabetical listing of more than 350 UML terms. Entries range from a sentence or two to several pages in length. (Class, operation, and use case are just a few of the important terms that are covered.) Though you will certainly need to be acquainted with software engineering principles, this reference will serve the working software developer well. As the authors note, this isnt UML for Dummies, but neither is it an arcane academic treatise. The authors succeed in delivering a readable reference that will answer any UML question, no matter how common or obscure. --Richard Dragan",

                  "abstract": "Out of memory (OOM) errors occur frequently in data-intensive applications that run atop distributed data-parallel frameworks, such as MapReduce and Spark. In these applications, the memory space is shared by the framework and user code. Since the framework hides the details of distributed execution, it is challenging for users to pinpoint the root causes and fix these OOM errors. This paper presents a comprehensive characteristic study on 123 real-world OOM errors in Hadoop and Spark applications. Our major findings include: (1) 12% errors are caused by the large data buffered/cached in the framework, which indicates that it is hard for users to configure the right memory quota to balance the memory usage of the framework and user code. (2) 37% errors are caused by the unexpected large runtime data, such as large data partition, hotspot key, and large key/value record. (3) Most errors (64%) are caused by memory-consuming user code, which carelessly processes unexpected large data or generates large in-memory computing results. Among them, 13% errors are also caused by the unexpected large runtime data. (4) There are three common fix patterns (used in 34% errors), namely changing the memory/dataflow-related configurations, dividing runtime data, and optimizing user code logic. Our findings inspire us to propose potential solutions to avoid the OOM errors: (1) providing dynamic memory management mechanisms to balance the memory usage of the framework and user code at runtime; (2) providing users with memory+disk data structures, since accumulating large computing results in in-memory data structures is a common cause (15% errors).",

                  "abstract": "Natural graphs with skewed distributions raise unique challenges to distributed graph computation and partitioning. Existing graph-parallel systems usually use a one-size-fits-all design that uniformly processes all vertices, which either suffer from notable load imbalance and high contention for high-degree vertices (e.g., Pregel and GraphLab) or incur high communication cost and memory consumption even for low-degree vertices (e.g., PowerGraph and GraphX). In this article, we argue that skewed distributions in natural graphs also necessitate differentiated processing on high-degree and low-degree vertices. We then introduce PowerLyra, a new distributed graph processing system that embraces the best of both worlds of existing graph-parallel systems. Specifically, PowerLyra uses centralized computation for low-degree vertices to avoid frequent communications and distributes the computation for high-degree vertices to balance workloads. PowerLyra further provides an efficient hybrid graph partitioning algorithm (i.e., hybrid-cut) that combines edge-cut (for low-degree vertices) and vertex-cut (for high-degree vertices) with heuristics. To improve cache locality of inter-node graph accesses, PowerLyra further provides a locality-conscious data layout optimization. PowerLyra is implemented based on the latest GraphLab and can seamlessly support various graph algorithms running in both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes. A detailed evaluation on three clusters using various graph-analytics and MLDM (Machine Learning and Data Mining) applications shows that PowerLyra outperforms PowerGraph by up to 5.53X (from 1.24X) and 3.26X (from 1.49X) for real-world and synthetic graphs, respectively, and is much faster than other systems like GraphX and Giraph, yet with much less memory consumption. A porting of hybrid-cut to GraphX further confirms the efficiency and generality of PowerLyra.",

The traditional methods for detecting community structure are based on selecting denser subgraphs inside the network. Here we propose to use the methods of cooperative game theory that highlight not only the link density but also the mechanisms of cluster formation. Specifically, we suggest two approaches from cooperative game theory: the first approach is based on the Myerson value, whereas the second approach is based on hedonic games. Both approaches allow to detect clusters with various resolution. However, the tuning of the resolution parameter in the hedonic games approach is particularly intuitive. Furthermore, the modularity based approach and its generalizations can be viewed as particular cases of the hedonic games.",

It is designed to scale up to multicores on a single server, as well as scale out to multiple servers in a cluster, offering significant, often over an order-of-magnitude, improvement over existing distributed graph engines on evaluated graph algorithms. GraM is also capable of processing graphs that are significantly larger than previously reported. In particular, using 64 servers (1,024 physical cores), it performs a PageRank iteration in 140 seconds on a synthetic graph with over one trillion edges, setting a new milestone for graph engines. GraMs efficiency and scalability comes from a judicious architectural design that exploits the benefits of multi-core and RDMA. GraM uses a simple message-passing based scaling architecture for both scaling up and scaling out to expose inherent parallelism. It further benefits from a specially designed multi-core aware RDMA-based communication stack that preserves parallelism in a balanced way and allows overlapping of communication and computation. A high degree of parallelism often comes at the cost of lower efficiency due to resource fragmentation. GraM is equipped with an adaptive mechanism that evaluates the cost and benefit of parallelism to decide the appropriate configuration. Combined, these mechanisms allow GraM to scale up and out with high efficiency.",

While its implementations(e.g., Pregel, Giraph, and Hama) achieve high scalability, frequent synchronization and communication among the workers can cause substantial parallel inefficiency. To help address this critical concern, this paper introduces the GraphHP(Graph Hybrid Processing) platform which inherits the friendly vertex-centric BSP programming interface and optimizes its synchronization and communication overhead. To achieve the goal, we first propose a hybrid execution model which differentiates between the computations within a graph partition and across the partitions, and decouples the computations within a partition from distributed synchronization and communication. By implementing the computations within a partition by pseudo-superstep iteration in memory, the hybrid execution model can effectively reduce synchronization and communication overhead while not requiring heavy scheduling overhead or graph-centric sequential algorithms. We then demonstrate how the hybrid execution model can be easily implemented within the BSP abstraction to preserve its simple programming interface. Finally, we evaluate our implementation of the GraphHP platform on classical BSP applications and show that it performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art BSP implementations. Our GraphHP implementation is based on Hama, but can easily generalize to other BSP platforms.",

Standard graph algorithms in this setting can incur unnecessary inefficiencies such as slow convergence or high communication or computation cost, typically due to structural properties of the input graphs such as large diameters or skew in component sizes. We describe several optimization techniques to address these inefficiencies. Our most general technique is based on the idea of performing some serial computation on a tiny fraction of the input graph, complementing Pregels vertex-centric parallelism. We base our study on thorough implementations of several fundamental graph algorithms, some of which have, to the best of our knowledge, not been implemented on Pregel-like systems before. The algorithms and optimizations we describe are fully implemented in our open-source Pregel implementation. We present detailed experiments showing that our optimization techniques improve runtime significantly on a variety of very large graph datasets.",

They reduce the complexity of the overall biological network by partitioning it into smaller manageable parts. While this reduction of complexity is their biggest strength, it is, at the same time, their biggest weakness. By removing what is deemed not important for the primary function of the pathway, biologists lose the ability to follow and understand cross-talks between pathways. Considering these cross-talks is, however, critical in many analysis scenarios, such as judging effects of drugs. In this paper we introduce Entourage, a novel visualization technique that provides contextual information lost due to the artificial partitioning of the biological network, but at the same time limits the presented information to what is relevant to the analysts task. We use one pathway map as the focus of an analysis and allow a larger set of contextual pathways. For these context pathways we only show the contextual subsets, i.e., the parts of the graph that are relevant to a selection. Entourage suggests related pathways based on similarities and highlights parts of a pathway that are interesting in terms of mapped experimental data. We visualize interdependencies between pathways using stubs of visual links, which we found effective yet not obtrusive. By combining this approach with visualization of experimental data, we can provide domain experts with a highly valuable tool. We demonstrate the utility of Entourage with case studies conducted with a biochemist who researches the effects of drugs on pathways. We show that the technique is well suited to investigate interdependencies between pathways and to analyze, understand, and predict the effect that drugs have on different cell types.",

In this paper, we argue that existing DSLs can be implemented on top of a general-purpose infrastructure that (i) supports very fine-grain tasks, (ii) implements autonomous, speculative execution of these tasks, and (iii) allows application-specific control of task scheduling policies. To support this claim, we describe such an implementation called the Galois system. We demonstrate the capabilities of this infrastructure in three ways. First, we implement more sophisticated algorithms for some of the graph analytics problems tackled by previous DSLs and show that end-to-end performance can be improved by orders of magnitude even on power-law graphs, thanks to the better algorithms facilitated by a more general programming model. Second, we show that, even when an algorithm can be expressed in existing DSLs, the implementation of that algorithm in the more general system can be orders of magnitude faster when the input graphs are road networks and similar graphs with high diameter, thanks to more sophisticated scheduling. Third, we implement the APIs of three existing graph DSLs on top of the common infrastructure in a few hundred lines of code and show that even for power-law graphs, the performance of the resulting implementations often exceeds that of the original DSL systems, thanks to the lightweight infrastructure.",

However, real-world graphs from different domains have very different characteristics, which often create bottlenecks in vertex-centric parallel graph computation. We identify three such important characteristics from a wide spectrum of real-world graphs, namely (1)skewed degree distribution, (2)large diameter, and (3)(relatively) high density. Among them, only (1) has been studied by existing systems, but many real-world power-law graphs also exhibit the characteristics of (2) and (3). In this paper, we propose a block-centric framework, called Blogel, which naturally handles all the three adverse graph characteristics. Blogel programmers may think like a block and develop efficient algorithms for various graph problems. We propose parallel algorithms to partition an arbitrary graph into blocks efficiently, and block-centric programs are then run over these blocks. Our experiments on large real-world graphs verified that Blogel is able to achieve orders of magnitude performance improvements over the state-of-the-art distributed graph computing systems.",

                  "abstract": "To meet the challenge of processing rapidly growing graph and network data created by modern applications, a number of distributed graph processing systems have emerged, such as Pregel and GraphLab. All these systems divide input graphs into partitions, and employ a think like a vertex programming model to support iterative graph computation. This vertex-centric model is easy to program and has been proved useful for many graph algorithms. However, this model hides the partitioning information from the users, thus prevents many algorithm-specific optimizations. This often results in longer execution time due to excessive network messages (e.g. in Pregel) or heavy scheduling overhead to ensure data consistency (e.g. in GraphLab). To address this limitation, we propose a new think like a graph programming paradigm. Under this graph-centric model, the partition structure is opened up to the users, and can be utilized so that communication within a partition can bypass the heavy message passing or scheduling machinery. We implemented this model in a new system, called Giraph++, based on Apache Giraph, an open source implementation of Pregel. We explore the applicability of the graph-centric model to three categories of graph algorithms, and demonstrate its flexibility and superior performance, especially on well-partitioned data. For example, on a web graph with 118 million vertices and 855 million edges, the graph-centric version of connected component detection algorithm runs 63X faster and uses 204X fewer network messages than its vertex-centric counterpart.",

Despite the poor accuracy of GPS on current mobile devices and the relatively high density of places in urban areas, it is possible to predict a users location with considerable precision by explicitly modeling both places and users and by combining a variety of signals about a users current context. Places are often simply modeled as a single latitude and longitude when in fact they are complex entities existing in both space and time and shaped by the millions of people that interact with them. Similarly, models of users reveal complex but predictable patterns of mobility that can be exploited for this task. We propose a novel spatial search algorithm that infers a users location by combining aggregate signals mined from billions of foursquare check-ins with real-time contextual information. We evaluate a variety of techniques and demonstrate that machine learning algorithms for ranking and spatiotemporal models of places and users offer significant improvement over common methods for location search based on distance and popularity.",

A standard approach distributes the graph over a cluster of nodes, but performing computations on a distributed graph is expensive if large amount of data have to be moved. Without partitioning the graph, communication quickly becomes a limiting factor in scaling the system up. Existing graph partitioning heuristics incur high computation and communication cost on large graphs, sometimes as high as the future computation itself. Observing that the graph has to be loaded into the cluster, we ask if the partitioning can be done at the same time with a lightweight streaming algorithm. We propose natural, simple heuristics and compare their performance to hashing and METIS, a fast, offline heuristic. We show on a large collection of graph datasets that our heuristics are a significant improvement, with the best obtaining an average gain of 76%. The heuristics are scalable in the size of the graphs and the number of partitions.

This paper describes the conceptualization and construction of a type of display, a glyphmap, that can show these multiple aspects. Glyphmaps are a specialization of multivariate glyph plots. Each spatial location is displayed with one glyph that represents the multiple measurements, often recorded over time, at that location. Glyphmaps allow the discovery of both local and global structure, with a particular focus on temporal relationships, important for studying climate change. They provide alternatives to colored, facetted maps, or statistical summaries such as principal components. Glyphmaps have been used sporadically for spatiotemporal data, and with the ideas and software described in this paper, it will be easier to produce them. The conceptualization described here also will enable developing interactive versions of glyphmaps, and make it simpler to explore the perceptual effects of different scales. The methods are developed for rectangular gridded data, but with some clever processing, which is explained, it is possible to get good glyphmaps of irregularly gridded data. Guides and reference marks, for different types of glyphs used in the glyphmaps, are also discussed. Copyright  2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

These applications typically involve data sets of massive scale. Fast convergence of the iterative computations on the massive data set is essential for these applications. In this paper, we explore the opportunity for accelerating iterative computations by prioritization. Instead of performing computations on all data points without discrimination, we prioritize the computations that help convergence the most, so that the convergence speed of iterative process is significantly improved. We develop a distributed computing framework, PrIter, which supports the prioritized execution of iterative computations. PrIter either stores intermediate data in memory for fast convergence or stores intermediate data in files for scaling to larger data sets. We evaluate PrIter on a local cluster of machines as well as on Amazon EC2 Cloud. The results show that PrIter achieves up to 50  speedup over Hadoop for a series of iterative algorithms. In addition, PrIter is shown better performance for iterative computations than other state-of-the-art distributed frameworks such as Spark and Piccolo.",

We demonstrate how to support rich visualizations without requiring a toolkit-specific data model and extend Protovis to enable declarative specification of animated transitions. To support cross-platform deployment, we introduce rendering and event-handling infrastructures decoupled from the runtime platform, letting designers retarget visualization specifications (e.g., from desktop to mobile phone) with reduced effort. We also explore optimizations such as runtime compilation of visualization specifications, parallelized execution, and hardware-accelerated rendering.

Hadoop is an open-source implementation of the MapReduce programming model. Hadoop is used by many companies including Yahoo!, Amazon, and Facebook to perform various data mining on large-scale data sets such as user search logs and visit logs. In these cases, it is very common to share the same computing resources by multiple users due to practical considerations about cost, system utilization, and manageability. However, Hadoop assumes that all cluster nodes are dedicated to a single user, failing to guarantee high performance in the shared MapReduce computation environment. In this paper, we propose two optimization schemes, prefetching and pre-shuffling, which improve the overall performance under the shared environment while retaining compatibility with the native Hadoop. The proposed schemes are implemented in the native Hadoop-0.18.3 as a plug-in component called HPMR (High Performance MapReduce Engine). Our evaluation on the Yahoo!Grid platform with three different workloads and seven types of test sets from Yahoo! shows that HPMR reduces the execution time by up to 73%.",

Even in a small dataset, clutter can make it hard for the viewer to find patterns, relationships and structure. In this paper, we define visual clutter as any aspect of the visualization that interferes with the viewers understanding of the data, and present the concept of clutter-based dimension reordering. Dimension order is an attribute that can significantly affect a visualizations expressiveness. By varying the dimension order in a display, it is possible to reduce clutter without reducing information content or modifying the data in any way. Clutter reduction is a display-dependent task. In this paper, we follow a three-step procedure for four different visualization techniques. For each display technique, first, we determine what constitutes clutter in terms of display properties; then we design a metric to measure visual clutter in this display; finally we search for an order that minimizes the clutter in a display",

The results show that real-world applications exhibit significantly less spatial locality, often exhibit less temporal locality, and have much larger data sets than the SPEC benchmark suite.

A taxonomy is developed to characterize the design space of such hybrid combinations.

When we use software, access a website, or view business or scientific graphics, our understanding is greatly enhanced or impeded by the way the information is presented.  This book explores the art and science of why we see objects the way we do. Based on the science of perception and vision, the author presents the key principles at work for a wide range of applications--resulting in visualization of improved clarity, utility, and persuasiveness. The book offers practical guidelines that can be applied by anyone: interaction designers, graphic designers of all kinds (including web designers), data miners, and financial analysts.    Complete update of the recognized source in industry, research, and academic for applicable guidance on information visualizing.  Includes the latest research and state of the art information on multimedia presentation.  More than 160 explicit design guidelines based on vision science.  A new final chapter that explains the process of visual thinking and how visualizations help us to think about problems.

Polylithic toolkits encourage extension by composition and follow a design philosophy similar to 3D scene graphs supported by toolkits including JavaSD and Openlnventor. Monolithic toolkits, on the other hand, encourage extension by inheritance, and are more akin to 2D graphical user interface toolkits such as Swing or MFC. We describe Jazz (a polylithic toolkit) and Piccolo (a monolithic toolkit), each of which we built to support interactive 2D structured graphics applications in general, and zoomable user interface applications in particular. We examine the trade offs of each approach in terms of performance, memory requirements, and programmability. We conclude that a polylithic approach is most suitable for toolkit builders, visual design software where code is automatically generated, and application builders where there is much customization of the toolkit. Correspondingly, we find that monolithic approaches appear to be best for application builders where there is not much customization of the toolkit.",

Cushion treemaps inherit the elegance of standard treemaps: compact, space-filling displays of hierarchical information, based on recursive subdivision of a rectangular image space. Intuitive shading is used to provide insight in the hierarchical structure. During the subdivision, ridges are added per rectangle, which are rendered with a simple shading model. The result is a surface that consists of recursive cushions. The method is efficient, effective, easy to use and implement, and has a wide applicability.",
