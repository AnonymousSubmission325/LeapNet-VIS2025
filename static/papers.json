However, applying sophisticated algorithmic methods would require advanced technical expertise that analysts do not necessarily have. Bridging this gap, we contribute CorpusVis, an interactive visual workspace, enabling scalable and multi-faceted analysis. Our proposed visual analytics dashboard provides access to computational methods, generating varying perspectives on the same data. The proposed application uses metadata including composers, type, epoch, and low-level features, such as pitch, melody, and rhythm. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a pair-analytics study with nine participants. The qualitative results show that CorpusVis supports users in performing exploratory and confirmatory analysis, leading them to new insights and findings. In addition, based on three exemplary workflows, we demonstrate how to apply our approach to different tasks, such as exploring musical features or comparing composers.",

Fully automated analysis instead misses human intuition about relevance. Existing approaches use abstract datadriven visualizations to assist music analysis but lack a suitable connection to the CMN. Therefore, music analysts often prefer to remain in their familiar context. Our approach enhances the traditional analysis workflow by complementing CMN with interactive visualization entities as minimally intrusive augmentations. Gradual stepwise transitions empower analysts to retrace and comprehend the relationship between the CMN and abstract data representations. We leverage glyphbased visualizations for harmony, rhythm and melody to demonstrate our techniques applicability. Designdriven visual query filters enable analysts to investigate statistical and semantic patterns on various abstraction levels. We conducted pair analytics sessions with 16 participants of different proficiency levels to gather qualitative feedback about the intuitiveness, traceability and understandability of our approach. The results show that MusicVis supports music analysts in getting new insights about feature characteristics while increasing their engagement and willingness to explore.",

Recently, it has been reported that playlists that have high diversity and smooth track transitions increase user satisfaction. Our previous method that used a two-dimensional space as a reinforcement learning environment has achieved these demands, but there remains the problem that the content of multi-dimensional acoustic features cannot be retained accurately. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present a new method of music playlist generation based on reinforcement learning using a graph structure constructed from multi-dimensional acoustic features directly. The new playlist generation provides greater diversity and smoother track transitions than the previous method.

The transcribed copy should allow musicians to compose, play and edit music by taking a picture of a music sheet. Complete transcription of sheet music would also enable more efficient archival. OMR facilitates examining sheet music statistically or searching for patterns of notations, thus helping use cases in digital musicology too. Recently, there has been a shift in OMR from using conventional computer vision techniques towards a deep learning approach. In this paper, we review relevant works in OMR, including fundamental methods and significant outcomes, and highlight different stages of the OMR pipeline. These stages often lack standard input and output representation and standardised evaluation. Therefore, comparing different approaches and evaluating the impact of different processing methods can become rather complex. This paper provides recommendations for future work, addressing some of the highlighted issues and represents a position in furthering this important field of research.",

Examining the notions of scalability and elasticity in interactive visualizations, we introduce a visualization of personal reading traces such as marginalia or markings inside the reference library of German realist author Theodor Fontane. To explore such a rich and extensive collection, meaningful visual forms of abstraction and detail are as important as the transitions between those states. Following a growing research interest in the role of fluid interactivity and animations between views, we are particularly interested in the potential of carefully designed transitions and consistent representations across scales. The resulting prototype addresses humanistic research questions about the interplay of distant and close reading with visualization research on continuous navigation along several granularity levels, using scrolling as one of the main interaction mechanisms. In addition to presenting the design process and resulting prototype, we present findings from a qualitative evaluation of the tool, which suggest that bridging between distant and close views can enhance exploration, but that transitions between views need to be crafted very carefully to facilitate comprehension.",

While the amount of data available through print media is vast in humanities, common issues arise as information available for the digitization process is typically fragmented. One reason is the physical distribution of data through print media that has to be collected and merged. Especially, merging causes issues due to differences in terminology, hampering automatic processing. Hence, digitizing musicological data raises a broad range of challenges. In this paper, we present the current state of the on-going musiXplora project, including a multi-faceted database and a visual exploration system for persons, places, objects, terms, media, events, and institutions of musicological interest. A particular focus of the project is using visualizations to overcome traditional problems of handling both, vast amounts and anomalies of information induced by the historicity of data. We present several use cases that highlight the capabilities of the system to support musicologists in their daily workflows.",

Particularly, concepts of historical periods have been criticized since they cannot account for the continuous and interwoven evolution of style. To systematically study this evolution, large corpora are necessary suggesting the use of computational strategies. This article presents such strategies and experiments relying on a dataset of 2000 audio recordings, which cover more than 300 years of music history. From the recordings, we extract different tonal features. We propose a method to visualize these features over the course of history using evolution curves. With the curves, we re-trace hypotheses concerning the evolution of chord transitions, intervals, and tonal complexity. Furthermore, we perform unsupervised clustering of recordings across composition years, individual pieces, and composers. In these studies, we found independent evidence of historical periods that broadly agrees with traditional views as well as recent data-driven experiments. This shows that computational experiments can provide novel insights into the evolution of styles.",

Deep neural networks are used in this area particularly for extracting latent factors of music items from audio signals or metadata and for learning sequential patterns of music items (tracks or artists) from music playlists or listening sessions. Latent item factors are commonly integrated into content-based filtering and hybrid MRS, whereas sequence models of music items are used for sequential music recommendation, e.g., automatic playlist continuation. This review article explains particularities of the music domain in RS research. It gives an overview of the state of the art that employs deep learning for music recommendation. The discussion is structured according to the dimensions of neural network type, input data, recommendation approach (content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or both), and task (standard or sequential music recommendation). In addition, we discuss major challenges faced in MRS, in particular in the context of the current research on deep learning.",

These features can serve as inputs to machine learning algorithms, or they can be analyzed statistically to derive musicological insights. jSymbolic implements 246 unique features, comprising 1497 different values, making it by far the most extensive symbolic feature extractor to date. These features are designed to be applicable to a diverse range of musics, and may be extracted from both symbolic music files as a whole and from windowed subsets of them. Researchers can also use jSymbolic as a platform for developing and distributing their own bespoke features, as it has an easily extensible plug-in architecture. In addition to implementing 135 new unique features, version 2.2 of jSymbolic places a special focus on functionality for avoiding biases associated with how symbolic music is encoded. In addition, new interface elements and documentation improve convenience, ease-of-use and accessibility to researchers with diverse ranges of technical expertise. jSymbolic now includes a GUI, command-line interface, API , flexible configuration file format, extensive manual and detailed tutorial. The enhanced effectiveness of jSymbolic 2.2s features is demonstrated in two sets of experiments: 1) genre classification and 2) Renaissance composer attribution.",

In addition, we take a look at the used text sources and at the typical data transformation steps required for the proposed visualizations.

Based on four case studies we illustrate different collaborative constellations within such cross-disciplinary projects that are influenced as much by the general project goals as by the expertise, disciplinary background and individual aims of the involved researchers. We found that such collaborations can introduce productive tensions that stretch the boundaries of visualization research and the involved humanities fields, often leaving team members adrift trying to make sense of findings that are the result of a mixture of different (sometimes competing) research questions, methodologies, and underlying assumptions. We discuss inherent challenges and productive synergies that these drifts can introduce. We argue that greater critical attention must be brought to the collaborative process itself in order to facilitate effective cross-disciplinary collaborations, and also enhance potential contributions and research impact for all involved disciplines. We introduce a number of guiding questions to facilitate critical awareness and reflection throughout the collaborative process, allowing for more transparency, productive communication, and equal participation within research teams.",

On the other end of the spectrum is a practice at the heart of the traditional humanities, close reading - the careful, in-depth analysis of a single text in order to extract, engage, and even generate as much productive meaning as possible. The true value of computation to close reading is still very much an open question. During a two-year design study, we explored this question with several poetry scholars, focusing on an investigation of sound and linguistic devices in poetry. The contributions of our design study include a problem characterization and data abstraction of the use of sound in poetry as well as Poemage, a visualization tool for interactively exploring the sonic topology of a poem. The design of Poemage is grounded in the evaluation of a series of technology probes we deployed to our poetry collaborators, and we validate the final design with several case studies that illustrate the disruptive impact technology can have on poetry scholarship. Finally, we also contribute a reflection on the challenges we faced conducting visualization research in literary studies.",

Humans play a central role in generating knowledge from the snippets of evidence emerging from visual data analysis. Although prior research provides frameworks that generalize this process, their scope is often narrowly focused so they do not encompass different perspectives at different levels. This paper proposes a knowledge generation model for visual analytics that ties together these diverse frameworks, yet retains previously developed models (e.g., KDD process) to describe individual segments of the overall visual analytic processes. To test its utility, a real world visual analytics system is compared against the model, demonstrating that the knowledge generation process model provides a useful guideline when developing and evaluating such systems. The model is used to effectively compare different data analysis systems. Furthermore, the model provides a common language and description of visual analytic processes, which can be used for communication between researchers. At the end, our model reflects areas of research that future researchers can embark on.",

Similarity, however, is a difficult thing to measure. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a tool by which researchers can obtain quantitative estimates of similarity among groups of items. More formally, MDS refers to a set of statistical techniques that are used to reduce the complexity of a data set, permitting visual appreciation of the underlying relational structures contained therein. The current paper provides an overview of MDS. We discuss key aspects of performing this technique, such as methods that can be used to collect similarity estimates, analytic techniques for treating proximity data, and various concerns regarding interpretation of the MDS output. MDS analyses of two novel data sets are also included, highlighting in step-by-step fashion how MDS is performed, and key issues that may arise during analysis.

Due to the importance of music classification in MIR research, rapid development of new methods, and lack of review papers on recent progress of the field, we provide a comprehensive review on audio-based classification in this paper and systematically summarize the state-of-the-art techniques for music classification.

These documents may describe a musical work in different ways comprising visual representations (e.,g., sheet music), symbolic representations (e.,g., MIDI, tablatures, chords), acoustic representations (CD recordings), audio-visual representations (videos), or text-based metadata. In this report, we give an overview of the main contributions and results of the seminar. We start with an executive summary, which describes the main topics, goals, and group activities. Then one finds a list of abstracts giving a more detailed overview of the participants contributions as well as of the ideas and results discussed in the group meetings and panels of our seminar.",

Even musically untrained listeners unconsciously analyze and segment music with regard to various musical aspects, for example, identifying recurrent themes or detecting temporal boundaries between contrasting musical parts. This paper gives an overview of state-of-theart methods for computational music structure analysis, where the general goal is to divide an audio recording into temporal segments corresponding to musical parts and to group these segments into musically meaningful categories. There are many different criteria for segmenting and structuring music audio. In particular, one can identify three conceptually different approaches, which we refer to as repetition-based, novelty-based, and homogeneitybased approaches. Furthermore, one has to account for different musical dimensions such as melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. In our state-of-the-art report, we address these different issues in the context of music structure analysis, while discussing and categorizing the most relevant and recent articles in this field.",

While the underlying techniques are traditionalNave Bayes, SVMliterary criticism, and the digital humanities more generally, differ from other domains in that they rarely admit ground truth into their discussions. Instead, data mining and machine learning are best understood in terms of provocationthe potential for outlier results to surprise a reader into attending to some aspect of a text not previously deemed significantas well as notreading or distant reading, the automated search for patterns across a much wider corpus than could be read and assimilated via traditional humanistic methods of close reading.

Similar genres are located close to each other and the pieces of music are located accordingly. Islands of Music are intended to support the exploration of unknown music collections. The user can listen to the music by clicking on its representation on the map and can explore island after island according to his or her musical taste. Islands of Music could be utilized by music stores to assist their customers in finding something new to buy. They could also serve as interfaces to digital music libraries, or they could simply be used to organize ones personal music collection at home. My thesis explores two main aspects related to music maps. One is how to compute the similarity of two pieces of music, so a whole music collection can be organized accordingly. The second aspect is how to present this information to the user in an intuitive way. The methods are illustrated and evaluated using a music collection consisting of 359 popular pieces from different genres with a total length of about 23 hours. This report briefly reviews related work in Section 2 and then presents the basic architecture of the system in Section 3. The results are briefly demonstrated in Section 4.

                  "abstract": "Several clustering algorithms can be applied to clustering in large multimedia databases. The effectiveness and efficiency of the existing algorithms, however, is somewhat limited, since clustering in multimedia databases requires clustering high-dimensional feature vectors and since multimedia databases often contain large amounts of noise. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new algorithm to clustering in large multimedia databases called DENCLUE (DENsity-based CLUstEring). The basic idea of our new approach is to model the overall point density analytically as the sum of influence functions of the data points. Clusters can then be identified by determining density-attractors and clusters of arbitrary shape can be easily described by a simple equation based on the overall density function. The advantages of our new approach are (1) it has a firm mathematical basis, (2) it has good clustering properties in data sets with large amounts of noise, (3) it allows a compact mathematical description of arbitrarily shaped clusters in high-dimensional data sets and (4) it is significantly faster than existing algorithms. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DENCLUE, we perform a series of experiments on a number of different data sets from CAD and molecular biology. A comparison with DBSCAN shows the superiority of our new approach.",

Instead of replacing the CMN, we augment sheet music with rhythmic fingerprints to mitigate the complexity originating from the simultaneous encoding of musical features. The proposed visual design exploits music theory concepts such as the rhythm tree to facilitate the understanding of rhythmic information. Juxtaposing sheet music and the rhythmic fingerprints maintains the connection to the familiar representation. To investigate the usefulness of the rhythmic fingerprint design for identifying and comparing rhythmic patterns, we conducted a controlled user study with four experts and four novices. The results show that the rhythmic fingerprints enable novice users to recognize rhythmic patterns that only experts can identify using non-augmented sheet music.",

When generating creative data with no objective function, it is hard to select or to find appropriate measurable features. This paper proposes a method to normalize data in MIDI files by 12 dimensional vector descriptors extracted from tonality as well as a novel technique for dimensionality reduction and visualization of extracted music data by 3D projections is discussed. Employing a non-overlapping sliding window through the composition, the harmonic features are found in a music piece. Then a self-similarity matrix is computed using distance metrics to analyze and project the resulting 3D feature vectors. Three dimensional projection creates a quantitative profile of a composition, which correlates the tone similarities along the music piece. The dimensionality reduction is compared with well-known autoencoder. Conducted tests show that our method preserves up to 90% of original data in the projection of reduced dimension. The advantages of the proposed method consist in a novel technique that provides interactive visualization and dynamically adjusts different metrics to observe the behavior of data during music information retrieval and recognition.",

CMN suffers from the complexity of its visual encoding and the need for extensive training to acquire proficiency and legibility. While alternative notations using additional visual variables (e.g., color to improve pitch identification) have been proposed, the community does not readily accept notation systems that vary widely from the CMN. Therefore, to support student musicians in understanding harmonic relationships, instead of replacing the CMN, we present a visualization technique that augments digital sheet music with a harmonic fingerprint glyph. Our design exploits the circle of fifths, a fundamental concept in music theory, as visual metaphor. By attaching such glyphs to each bar of a composition we provide additional information about the salient harmonic features available in a musical piece. We conducted a user study to analyze the performance of experts and non-experts in an identification and comparison task of recurring patterns. The evaluation shows that the harmonic fingerprint supports these tasks without the need for close-reading, as when compared to a not-annotated music sheet.",

We find that judiciously staged animated transitions can improve subjects accuracy at identifying the aggregation performed, though sometimes with longer response times than with static transitions. Through an analysis of participants rankings and qualitative responses, we find a consistent preference for animation over static transitions and highlight visual features subjects report relying on to make their judgments.

This enables practitioners and researchers of digital humanities and information visualization, alike, to conceptualize, create, and analyze novel music notation methods. Based on the analysis of relevant stakeholders and their usage of music notation as a mean of communication, we identify a set of relevant features typically encoded in different annotations and encodings, as used by interpreters, performers, and readers of music. We analyze the visual mappings of musical dimensions for varying notation methods to highlight gaps and frequent usages of encodings, visual channels, and Gestalt laws. This detailed analysis leads us to the conclusion that such an under-researched area in information visualization holds the potential for fundamental research.

The proposed representation system is graph-based and could theoretically represent music both from a horizontal (contrapuntal) and from a vertical (harmonic) point of view, by keeping into account contextual and harmonic information. It could also include relationships between internal variations of motifs and themes. This is achieved by gradually simplifying the melodies and generating layers of reductions that include only the most important notes from a structural and harmonic viewpoint. This representation system has been tested in a music information retrieval task, namely melodic similarity, and compared to another system that performs the same task but does not consider any contextual or harmonic information, showing how the structural information is needed in order to find certain relations between musical pieces. Moreover, a new dataset consisting of more than 5000 leadsheets is presented, with additional meta-musical information taken from different web databases, including author, year of first performance, lyrics, genre and stylistic tags.",

Although the most common way to learn music is through the study of musical scores, this approach is demanding in terms of learning ability, given the required implicit knowledge of music theoretical concepts. Learning musical rules is hard, especially for classical music. To simplify this task, visualization is one of the most promising approaches, also thanks to the human visual cognition ability (i.e., visual memory, visual attention, and so on). This work aims at building a visual tool, named VisualHarmony, to help people in composing music pieces in a quick and efficient way (i.e., avoiding specific errors as dictated by classical music theory rules). More specifically, a visualization technique able to represent harmonic structures has been evaluated by teachers of Conservatory classes and from domain experts in order to collect requirements used to define graphical features needed to facilitate the study of the rules used in classical music, and to implement VisualHarmony. We have focused our attention on a specific type of music compositions, i.e., the chorale style (4-voice music). VisualHarmony was tested in order to analyze system usability and user satisfaction. Results of these studies provided us with positive feedback about the effectiveness of the idea, the pleasantness of the graphical choices, the satisfaction of the users with regard to the easiness and the usefulness of the provided tool.",

Such passages are vital for compression, classification and prediction tasks in MIR, and algorithms employing different techniques have been proposed to find musical patterns automatically. Human-annotated patterns have been collected and used to evaluate pattern discovery algorithms, e.g., in the Discovery of Repeated Themes & Sections MIREX task. However, state-of-the-art algorithms are not yet able to reproduce human-annotated patterns. To understand what gives rise to the discrepancy between algorithmically extracted patterns and human-annotated patterns, we use jSymbolic to extract features from patterns, visualise the feature space using PCA and perform a comparative analysis using classification techniques. We show that it is possible to classify algorithmically extracted patterns, human-annotated patterns and randomly sampled passages. This implies: (a) Algorithmically extracted patterns possess different properties than human-annotated patterns (b) Algorithmically extracted patterns have different structures than randomly sampled passages (c) Human-annotated patterns contain more information than randomly sampled passages despite subjectivity involved in the annotation process. We further discover that rhythmic features are of high importance in the classification process, which should influence future research on automatic pattern discovery.",

                  "abstract": "ABSTRACT Musicologists and music theorists have traditionally been early adopters of technological tools to assist with research. The earliest digital humanities projects in musicology and music theory came directly out of humanities computing and quantitative analytical technologies developed in the 1980s, but newer projects created since the mid-2000s still reflect this past of algorithmic analysis and archival compilation, retrieval, and display. Computational and archival research is, currently, only one branch of digital humanities. The umbrella of digital humanities research now also includes digital publishing, philosophies of digital research, and born digital projects that cannot exist outside of a digital medium (e.g., virtual reality or 3D modeling). This shift in the digital humanities represents a move to a bigger tent that includes more types of projects. Musicological and musico-theoretical scholarship is slowly moving in this direction. Music librarians have been at the forefront of identifying and promoting new digital tools and archives, even though these projects have tended to remain at the periphery of musico-theoretical discourse. They should be on the lookout for bigger tent projects, such as medieval and renaissance projects like the Isabelle DEste Archive, Opening the Geesebook, and the Experience of Worship. These projects are characterized by being iterative and multi-modally engaging, as well as emerging from communities of practice and intentionally engaging a public audience. Music librarians should also be aware of systemic challenges to creating and supporting digital projects because these issues are at the center of libraries supporting all types of digital scholarship.",

Such an ability is built over time through the study of music theory, the understanding of rules that guide the composition of music, and countless hours of practice. The learning process is hard, especially for classical music, where the rigidity of the music structures and styles requires great effort to understand, assimilate, and then master the learned notions. In particular, we focused our attention on a specific type of music compositions, namely, music in chorale style (four-voice music). Composing such type of music is often perceived as a difficult task because of the rules the composer has to adhere to. In this article, we propose a visualization technique that can help people lacking a strong knowledge of music theory. The technique exploits graphic elements to draw the attention on the possible errors in the composition. We then developed an interactive system, named VisualMelody, that employs the proposed visualization technique to facilitate the understanding of the structure of music compositions. The aim is to allow people to make four-voice music composition in a quick and effective way, that is, avoiding errors, as dictated by classical music theory rules. We have involved 40 people in testing VisualMelody in order to analyze its effectiveness, its usability, and the overall user satisfaction. We partitioned the people involved in the evaluation study into two groups evenly splitting the musical expertise. Then, we had one group use VisualMelody without the visualization facilities and the other using the tool enhanced with our visualization. On average, people in the group that used our visualization were 60% faster and produced music with less errors.",

There are a number of protocols for collaborative text editing, but so far there has been no precise specification of their desired behavior, and several of these protocols have been shown not to satisfy even basic expectations. This paper provides a precise specification of a replicated list object, which models the core functionality of replicated systems for collaborative text editing. We define a strong list specification, which we prove is implemented by an existing protocol, as well as a weak list specification, which admits additional protocol behaviors. A major factor determining the efficiency and practical feasibility of a collaborative text editing protocol is the space overhead of the metadata that the protocol must maintain to ensure correctness. We show that for a large class of list protocols, implementing either the strong or the weak list specification requires a metadata overhead that is at least linear in the number of elements deleted from the list. The class of protocols to which this lower bound applies includes all list protocols that we are aware of, and we show that one of these protocols almost matches the bound.",

Based on insights from previous studies, a questionnaire was developed with several design adaptations of written music. The questionnaire was filled out by 72 Dutch children aged between 8 and 13 years. The results show that children with dyslexia did make significantly more mistakes in reading pitch than non-dyslexic children. The number of mistakes was reduced by enlarging the staves and also by writing all the stems of the notes in the same direction. Using differently-coloured lines in the staff did not reduce the amount of mistakes and was in some cases counterproductive.",

The system has been built using diverse technologies, including Python, JavaScript, PHP, and third-party libraries, and can be extended for further research purposes. To test various aural-to-visual mapping options and expressiveness of key music features, timbre, rhythm, melody, harmony, and loudness have been visualized. The final music visualization setup employs timbre, harmony, and note intensity development over time expressed as spatial organization and color variation cues. The resulting visual fingerprints are capable of conveying important information about music, including its genre, instrumental diversity, and melodic complexity.

While previous studies have shown that these mental representations of music can be acquired rapidly and can influence preference, it is still unclear which aspects of music influence learning and preference formation. This article reports two experiments that use an artificial musical system to examine two questions: (1) which aspects of music matter most for learning, and (2) which aspects of music matter most for preference formation. Two aspects of music are tested: melody and harmony. In Experiment 1 we tested the learning and liking of a new musical system that is manipulated melodically so that only some of the possible conditional probabilities between successive notes are presented. In Experiment 2 we administered the same tests for learning and liking, but we used a musical system that is manipulated harmonically to eliminate the property of harmonic whole-integer ratios between pitches. Results show that disrupting melody (Experiment 1) disabled the learning of music without disrupting preference formation, whereas disrupting harmony (Experiment 2) does not affect learning and memory but disrupts preference formation. Results point to a possible dissociation between learning and preference in musical knowledge.",

It unifies previous work by Brower, Callender, Cohn, Douthett, Gollin, OConnell, Quinn, Steinbach, and myself, while also introducing new models of voice-leading structureincluding a three-note octahedral Tonnetz and tetrahedral models of four-note diatonic and chromatic chords. !#% &()*#&# &+,%-..+ *(,*(#(/& voice leading using two different kinds of diagram. In note-based graphs, points represent notes, and chords cor- respond to extended shapes of some kind; the prototypical example is the Tonnetz, where major and minor triads are triangles, and where parsimoni- ous voice leadings are reflections (flips) preserving a triangles edge. In chord-based graphs, by contrast, each point represents an entire sonority, and efficient voice leading corresponds to short-distance motion in the space, typically along an edge of a lattice. This difference is illustrated in Figure 1, which offers two perspectives on the same set of musical possibilities: on the top, we have the traditional note-based Tonnetz, while on the bottom we have Jack Douthett and Peter Steinbachs (1998) chord-based chicken-wire torus. 1 These figures both represent single-step (or parsimonious) voice leading among major and minor triads and are dual to each other in a sense that will be discussed shortly. In A Geometry of Music (Tymoczko 2011), I provide a general recipe for constructing chord-based graphs, beginning with the continuous geometri- cal spaces representing all n-note chords and showing how different scales determine different kinds of cubic lattices within them. I also showed that nearly even chords (such as those prevalent in Western tonal music) are rep- resented by three main families of lattices. Two of these are particularly use- ful in analysis: the first consists of a circle of n-dimensional cubes linked by",

Once the rhythm is extracted, we use dynamic programming to compare several sequences. We report results of analysis on the size of rhythm patterns that are specific to a unique piece, as well as experiments on similarity queries (ragtime music and Bach chorale variations). These results show that long and intensity+ extractions are often good choices for rhythm extraction.

By displaying text data in a logical layout (e.g., color graphs), text visualization presents a direct way to observe the documents as well as understand the relationship between them. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Exemplar-based visualization (EV), to visualize an extremely large text corpus. Capitalizing on recent advances in matrix approximation and decomposition, EV presents a probabilistic multidimensional projection model in the low-rank text subspace with a sound objective function. The probability of each document proportion to the topics is obtained through iterative optimization and embedded to a low dimensional space using parameter embedding. By selecting the representative exemplars, we obtain a compact approximation of the data. This makes the visualization highly efficient and flexible. In addition, the selected exemplars neatly summarize the entire data set and greatly reduce the cognitive overload in the visualization, leading to an easier interpretation of large text corpus. Empirically, we demonstrate the superior performance of EV through extensive experiments performed on the publicly available text data sets.",

                  "abstract": "[1] This report presents a graphing method designed to aid the study of rhythm and expressive timing in beat-based music.(1) I show how the polar coordinate system can be used to describe and analyze different features of expressive timing. Numerous studies have shown that expressive timing lies at the core of rhythm production. The evidence-reviewed by Clarke (1999)-confirms that musicians often place attack points along a continuum of beat subdivision values rather than on the predetermined slots afforded by metrical grid spacing, thus imbuing the performance with expressive depth. This departure from a clear-cut temporal lattice is inadequately, if at all, represented by standard music notation. Like the piano roll representation used by MIDI sequencers, standard music notation is a kind of visualization tool whose two axes capture two paramount features of music: time horizontally and pitch vertically. The need to represent specific aspects of music in a detailed way has led to the design of various visualization methods, as I discuss next.Visualization and Circles[2] Certain properties of musical structure can be depicted using rhythmograms (Todd, 1994), self-similarity squares (Foote & Cooper, 2001), or hierarchic trees (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983). Timbre can be viewed with various forms of spectrograms, hemiolas with ski-hill graphs (Cohn, 2001), harmony with quotient topologies (Tymoczko, 2006), and the pitch chroma cycle with helices (Shepard, 1983). Geometrical thinking has also served the composition process, as evidenced by the hand-drawn schematics of Reynolds (2004) and Wishart (1996), to name just two recent examples.[3] Visualizations also play a role in the realm of rhythm and expressive timing. Even though microtiming information is sometimes displayed with numerical tables, visualization strategies are often used to communicate information on a more perceptually intuitive level. Desain & Honing (2003) devised a triangular chronotopic map that plots the temporal nuances and categorical boundaries of three-note rhythms. An important and appealing feature of their graphing method is that every point in the map represents a unique rhythmic pattern. Dots that are near each other in the graph denote similar sounding rhythms, forming clumps that represent distinct perceptual categories. However, the map is restricted to rhythms that consist of three durations only and is therefore of limited use in most real-world musical contexts. For longer rhythms, note-for-note expressive timing data are often visualized with an XY graph where evenly partitioned time units (such as notes or measures) demarcate score position along the abscissa; the ordinate usually plots tempo, interonset interval, or deviation from a metronomic subdivision. This type of design has proved helpful in different musical contexts including jazz (e.g., Benadon, 2006; Collier & Collier, 2002) and Western classical music (e.g., Friberg & Sundberg, 1999; Palmer, 1996; Repp, 2002), but its linear left-to-right orientation tends to conceal the recursive nature of beat-based patterns.[4] Circles enjoy a privileged status in the visualization of musical time. They have been tapped by music theorists, ethnomusicologists, and computer scientists to represent cyclical aspects of rhythm. London (2004, p. 64) visualizes meter by placing peaks of attentional energy (beats and subdivisions) along a circles circumference. Time also flows around a circle in Beckers (1980, p. 107) representation of Javanese gamelan gongan (structural units of time marked by a gong), which are cyclical rather than linear, and in Ankus (2000) representation of African rhythms. Locke (1996, p. 90) and Collins (2004, p. 59) also use circles to characterize African rhythms, taking the circular concept one step further by employing concentric circles that describe the stratification of polyrhythm. In the work of Toussaint (2005) and McLachlan (2000), the circle facilitates mathematical explanations of rhythm such as maximal evenness and similarity measures. ",

The method segments a piece into uniform time slices, and determines the most likely key in each slice. It then generates the visualization by dynamically showing the sequence of keys as translucent, growing discs on the twodimensional plane. The frequency of a key is indicated by the size of its colored disc. Each color and position corresponds to a key, and related keys are shown in proximity with related colors. The visual result effectively presents the changing distribution of the keys employed. The proposed visualization is an improvement over more basic charting methods, such as histograms, and it maintains standards of information design in the form of added dimensionality, color, and animation. We show that the visualization is invariant under music transformations that preserve the pieces identity. We conclude by illustrating how this method may be used to visually distinguish between tonal progression and distribution patterns in western classical versus Armenian folk music.",

                  "abstract": "An efficient model for discovering repeated patterns in symbolic representations of music is presented. Combinatorial redundancy inherent in the pattern discovery paradigm is commonly filtered using global selective mechanisms, based on pattern frequency and length. We propose an alternate approach founded on the concept of closed pattern and enabling detailed analyses through adaptive selection of most specific descriptions in a multidimensional parametric space. A notion of cyclic pattern is introduced, enabling an adapted filtering of another form of combinatorial redundancy caused by successive repetitions of patterns. The use of cyclic patterns implies a necessary chronological scanning of the piece, and the addition of mechanisms formalizing particular Gestalt principles. This study shows therefore that automated analysis of music cannot rely on simple mathematical or statistical approaches, but needs rather complex and detailed modeling of the cognitive system ruling listening processes. The resulting algorithm is able to offer for the first time compact and relevant motivic analyses of simple monodies, and may therefore be applied to automated indexing of symbolic music databases. Numerous additional mechanisms need to be added in order to consider all aspects of music expression, including polyphony and complex musical transformations.",

                  "abstract": "Book review: Kenneth Drake. The Beethoven Sonatas and the Creative Experience Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994 IN THIS SECOND STUDY OF BEETHOVENS PIANO SONATAS, Kenneth Drake, professor of piano at the University of Illinois and fortepianist, expands on what he had previously broached, but not developed. The Sonatas of Beethoven As He Played and Taught Them (1972) concerned mainly such technical matters as announced by the various chapter headings: Tempo and Modifications of Tempo, Dynamics, Pedaling, Ornamentation. The two remaining chapters of the earlier book treat Beethovens creative milieu and the milieu of the present interpreter whose aim is at bottom more a matter of philosophy than of execution. In The Beethoven Sonatas and the Creative Experience Drake begins where the earlier book ends. The present work, Drake declares, is not an exercise in musicology or performance practice, nor does it offer measure by measure analysis. Instead it is a work about meaning a personal account of studying, teaching, and playing the Beethoven sonatas, the significance they assume in the innermost self, and, especially, the musical basis for their significance. The immediate purpose is to isolate ideas within the score and to perceive meaning in them and derive meaning from them. Drake readily admits the difficulties inherent in the idea of meaning in the context of a musical composition. And yet, following the example, for example, of Owen Jander, who took his cue from, among others, Adolph Marx and Carl Czerny, Drake insists upon the significance of the extra-musical images that ultimately imbued a newly found musical idea with character. The humanly moving experience that gave rise to Beethovens musical ideas provides the key to the performers total involvement in the music, an involvement that rises above technique to communicate the inner, the spiritual, content of the printed score. In describing Beethovens visions and images as the true key to interpretation, Drake insists, Czerny was stating as the one, all-encompassing rule of performance practice for the playing of Beethoven, total personal involvement. The emphasis upon the extra-musical might lead the reader to believe, perhaps to fear, that Drakes book is a regression to a branch of Romantic music criticism that naively saw paintings in every tune, and a story in every period. The book, however, avoids all such anachronism, and provides in fact a highly sophisticated analysis of the musical content of the sonatas. Drakes point remains, however, that unless the player accepts the basic humanity of what Beethoven conveys, he or she is bound merely to go through the motions, however so competently, without conveying meaning. The introductory portion of the book ends with the reminder of the significance to Beethoven of the concept of suffering. Drakes is the willfully philosophical Beethoven, driven to reach beyond his grasp, who finds meaning in struggle. Drake quotes Beethovens joy through suffering letter to Countess Erdody, a letter in which the composer asserts that Man ... must endure without complaining and feel his worthlessness and then again achieve his perfection, that perfection which the almighty will then bestow upon him. The performer must therefore reach beyond, risk failure, even, as Drake quotes Lily Kraus, risk shame. The truly communicated Beethoven sonata, in Krauss words, sheds grace upon the audience. And to experience grace is to be forgiven for the one forgiven and to forgive for the forgiven It is an act on the part of both performer and listener requiring a belief in meaning, and this is the ultimate involvement. It would be tempting to say here, so much for philosophy. But the strength of the book, in fact, lies precisely in its philosophical conceptualization. Kenneth Drake is a seasoned teacher and performer who has devoted his career to the accurate conveyance of the spirit as well as the body of the works of the great composers, particularly those of Beethoven.

                  "abstract": "This book explores the relationships between language, music, and the brain by pursuing four key themes and the crosstalk among them: song and dance as a bridge between music and language; multiple levels of structure from brain to behavior to culture; the semantics of internal and external worlds and the role of emotion; and the evolution and development of language. The book offers specially commissioned expositions of current research accessible both to experts across disciplines and to non-experts. These chapters provide the background for reports by groups of specialists that chart current controversies and future directions of research on each theme. The book looks beyond mere auditory experience, probing the embodiment that links speech to gesture and music to dance. The study of the brains of monkeys and songbirds illuminates hypotheses on the evolution of brain mechanisms that support music and language, while the study of infants calibrates the developmental timetable of their capacities. The result is a unique book that will interest any reader seeking to learn more about language or music and will appeal especially to readers intrigued by the relationships of language and music with each other and with the brain.

Drawing analogies with Kasparovs Advanced Chess and the deliberate development of unstable aircraft using fly-by-wire technology, the article argues for a collaborative relationship with the computer that can free the artist to more fearlessly engage with the challenges of working with emergent systems that exhibit complex unpredictable behavior. The article also describes Species Explorer, the system the author has created in response to these challenges to assist exploration of the possibilities afforded by parametrically driven generative systems. This system provides a framework to allow the user to use a number of different techniques to explore new parameter combinations, including genetic algorithms, and machine learning methods.

But the claim of creativity is often assessed, subjectively only on the part of the researcher and not objectively at all. This article provides theoretical motivation for more systematic evaluation of musical metacreation and computationally creative systems and presents an overview of current methods used to assess human and machine creativity that may be adapted for this purpose. In order to highlight the need for a varied set of evaluation tools, a distinction is drawn among three types of creative systems: those that are purely generative, those that contain internal or external feedback, and those that are capable of reflection and self-reflection. To address the evaluation of each of these aspects, concrete examples of methods and techniques are suggested to help researchers (1) evaluate their systems creative process and generated artefacts, and test their impact on the perceptual, cognitive, and affective states of the audience, and (2) build mechanisms for reflection into the creative system, including models of human perception and cognition, to endow creative systems with internal evaluative mechanisms to drive self-reflective processes. The first type of evaluation can be considered external to the creative system and may be employed by the researcher to both better understand the efficacy of their system and its impact and to incorporate feedback into the system. Here we take the stance that understanding human creativity can lend insight to computational approaches, and knowledge of how humans perceive creative systems and their output can be incorporated into artificial agents as feedback to provide a sense of how a creation will impact the audience. The second type centers around internal evaluation, in which the system is able to reason about its own behavior and generated output. We argue that creative behavior cannot occur without feedback and reflection by the creative/metacreative system itself. More rigorous empirical testing will allow computational and metacreative systems to become more creative by definition and can be used to demonstrate the impact and novelty of particular approaches.",

These quantitative relations should mirror the human perception of music similarity, which is however highly subjective with low inter-rater agreement. Unfortunately this principal problem has been given little attention in MIR so far. Since it is not meaningful to have computational models that go beyond the level of human agreement, these levels of inter-rater agreement present a natural upper bound for any algorithmic approach. We will illustrate this fundamental problem in the evaluation of MIR systems using results from two typical application scenarios: (i) modelling of music similarity between pieces of music; (ii) music structure analysis within pieces of music. For both applications, we derive upper bounds of performance which are due to the limited inter-rater agreement. We compare these upper bounds to the performance of state-of-the-art MIR systems and show how the upper bounds prevent further progress in developing better MIR systems.",

Occasionally, researchers have attempted to evaluate the success of these generative music systems by measuring the perceived quality or style conformity of isolated musical outputs. These tests are often conducted in the form of comparisons between computer-aided output and non-computer-aided output. The model of the Turing Test (TT), Alan Turings proposed Imitation Game (Turing 1950), has been submitted and employed as a framework for these comparisons. In this context, it is assumed that if machine output sounds like, or is preferred to, human output, the machine has succeeded. The nature of this success is rarely questioned, and is often interpreted as evidence of a successful generative music system. Such listener surveys, within necessary statistical and psychological constraints, may be pooled to gauge common responses to and interpretations of musicyet these surveys are not TTs. This article argues that Turings well-known proposal cannot be applied to executing and evaluating listener surveys.",

Inspired by this challenge, we sought to apply machine-learning methods to the problem of musical style modeling. Our work so far has produced examples of musical generation and applications to a computer-aided composition system. Machine learning consists of deriving a mathematical model, such as a set of stochastic rules, from a set of musical examples. The act of musical composition involves a highly structured mental process. Although it is complex and difficult to formalize, it is clearly far from being a random activity. Our research seeks to capture some of the regularity apparent in the composition process by using statistical and information theoretic tools to analyze musical pieces. The resulting models can be used for inference and prediction and, to a certain extent, to generate new works that imitate the style of the great masters.",

We consider this to be important since different methodologies are appropriate for different motivations and goals. We argue that a widespread failure to specify the motivations and goals involved has lead to a methodological malaise in music related research. A brief consideration of some of the earliest attempts to produce computational systems for the composition of music leads us to identify four activities involving the development of computer programs which compose music each of which is inspired by different practical or theoretical motivations. These activities are algorithmic composition, the design of compositional tools, the computational modelling of musical styles and the computational modelling of music cognition. We consider these four motivations in turn, illustrating the problems that have arisen from failing to distinguish between them. We propose a terminology that clearly differentiates the activities defined by the four motivations and present methodological suggestions for research in each domain. While it is dearly important for researchers to embrace developments in related disciplines, we argue that research in the four domains will continueto stagnate unless the motivations and aims of research projects are clearly stated and appropriate methodologies are adopted for developing and evaluating systems that compose music.",

We present a smart guitar prototype that allows retrieving songs from large online music databases using criteria different from conventional music search, which were derived from interviewing thirty guitar players. We investigate three interaction methods coupled with four search criteria (tempo, chords, key and tuning) exploiting intelligent capabilities in the instrument: i) keywords-based retrieval using an embedded touchscreen; ii) cloud-computing where recorded content is transmitted to a server that extracts relevant audio features; iii) edge-computing where the guitar detects audio features and sends the request directly. Overall, the evaluation of these methods with beginner, intermediate and expert players showed a strong appreciation for the direct connectivity of the instrument with an online database and the approach to the search based on the actual musical content rather than conventional textual criteria, such as song title or artist name.",

Recent advances in deep learning have turned typical OMR obstacles into clearly solvable problems, especially the stages that visually process the input image, such as staff line removal or detection of music-notation objects. However, merely detecting objects is not enough for retrieving the actual content, as music notation is a configurational writing system where the semantic of a primitive is defined by its relationship to other primitives. Thus, OMR systems must employ a notation assembly stage to infer such relationships among the detected objects. So far, this stage has been addressed by devising a set of predefined rules or grammars, which hardly generalize well. In this work, we formulate the notation assembly stage from a set of detected primitives as a machine learning problem. Our notation assembly is modeled as a graph that stores syntactic relationships among primitives, which allows us to capture the configuration of symbols in a music-notation document. Our results over the handwritten sheet music corpus MUSCIMA++ show 95.2% precision, 96.0% recall, and an F-score of 95.6% in establishing the correct syntactic relationships. When inferring relationships on data from a music object detector, the model achieves 93.2% precision, 91.5% recall and an F-score of 92.3%.",

Detecting this structural element is, therefore, a natural step in most Optical Music Recognition systems. However, many systems struggle to reliably detect staves. This paper investigates whether computers can learn to detect staves with a convolutional neural network given only a small set of images for which annotation are available. After an initial training phase, the network is asked to make prediction on a larger test dataset. A human annotator reviews the predictions and approves or rejects samples. Approved samples will be added to the training set for the next iteration to incrementally expand the training set and allow the network to operate well on a variety of music scores. After four iterations, we were able to obtain staff bounding box annotations for 14,000 out of 20,000 scores in our dataset. Although the evaluated approach has structural flaws that lead to imprecise results and deficits when detecting non-straight staves, it can serve as a viable starting point for future staff detection systems.",

We show that a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation combined with a trivial detector already establishes a high baseline for this task, and we propose tricks that further improve detection performance: training against convex hulls of symbol masks, and multichannel output models that enable feature sharing for semantically related symbols. The latter is helpful especially for clefs, which have severe impacts on the overall OMR result. We then integrate the networks into an OMR pipeline by applying a subsequent notation assembly stage, establishing a new baseline result for pitch inference in handwritten music at an f-score of 0.81. Given the automatically inferred pitches we run retrieval experiments on handwritten scores, providing first empirical evidence that utilizing the powerful image processing models brings content-based search in large musical manuscript archives within reach.",

Several approaches and systems have been proposed that try to solve this problem by using expert knowledge and specialized algorithms that tend to fail at generalization to a broader set of scores, imperfect image scans or data of different formatting. In this paper we propose a new approach to solve OMR by investigating how humans read music scores and by imitating that behavior with machine learning. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we conduct two experiments that teach a machine to distinguish entire music sheets from arbitrary content through frame-by-frame classification and distinguishing between 32 classes of handwritten music symbols which can be a basis for object detection. Both tasks can be performed at high rates of confidence (> 98%) which is comparable to the performance of humans on the same task.",

Ground truth in MUSCIMA++ is a notation graph, which our analysis shows to be a necessary and sufficient representation of music notation. Building on the CVC-MUSCIMA dataset for staffline removal, the MUSCIMA++ dataset v1.0 consists of 140 pages of handwritten music, with 91254 manually annotated notation symbols and 82247 explicitly marked relationships between symbol pairs. The dataset allows training and directly evaluating models for symbol classification, symbol localization, and notation graph assembly, and indirectly musical content extraction, both in isolation and jointly.

For that, we present a labeled corpus containing 576 staves, along with a baseline recognition system based on a combination of hidden Markov models and N-gram language models. The baseline error obtained at symbol level is about 40 % which, given the difficulty of the task, can be considered a good starting point for future developments.

In contrast to previous region-based detectors such as Fast/Faster R-CNN that apply a costly per-region subnetwork hundreds of times, our region-based detector is fully convolutional with almost all computation shared on the entire image. To achieve this goal, we propose position-sensitive score maps to address a dilemma between translation-invariance in image classification and translation-variance in object detection. Our method can thus naturally adopt fully convolutional image classifier backbones, such as the latest Residual Networks (ResNets), for object detection. We show competitive results on the PASCAL VOC datasets (e.g., 83.6% mAP on the 2007 set) with the 101-layer ResNet. Meanwhile, our result is achieved at a test-time speed of 170ms per image, 2.5-20 times faster than the Faster R-CNN counterpart.

We propose novel Semantic Web ontologies (1) to provide a common structure for feature data formats and (2) to represent computational workflows of audio features facilitating their comparison. The Audio Feature Ontology provides a descriptive framework for expressing different conceptualisations of and designing linked data formats for content-based audio features. To accommodate different views in organising features, the ontology does not impose a strict hierarchical structure, leaving this open to task and tool specific ontologies that derive from a common vocabulary. The ontologies are based on the analysis of existing feature extraction tools and the MIR literature, which was instrumental in guiding the design process. They are harmonised into a library of modular interlinked ontologies that describe the different entities and activities involved in music creation, production and consumption.",

In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with attention mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

However, the development of such systems is still largely unexplored. Some studies have been carried out but the use of particular little datasets has led to avoid objective comparisons between different approaches. To solve this situation, this work presents the Handwritten Online Musical Symbols (HOMUS) dataset, which consists of 15200 samples of 32 types of musical symbols from 100 different musicians. Several alternatives of recognition for the two modalities -online, using the strokes drawn by the pen, and offline, using the image generated after drawing the symbol- are also presented. Some experiments are included aimed to draw main conclusions about the recognition of these data. It is expected that this work can establish a binding point in the field of recognition of online handwritten music notation and serve as a baseline for future developments.",

Its great significance derives from the ease with which we can then proceed with the extraction of musical symbols. All OMR tasks are usually achieved using binary images by setting thresholds that can be local or global. These techniques however, may remove relevant information of the music sheet and introduce artifacts which will degrade results in the later stages of the process. It arises therefore a need to create a method that reduces the loss of information due to the binarization. The baseline for the methodology proposed in this paper follows the shortest path algorithm proposed in [CardosoTPAMI08]. The concept of strong staff pixels (SSPs), which is a set of pixels with a high probability of belonging to a staff line, is proposed to guide the cost function. The SSP allows to overcome the results of the binary based detection and to generalize the binary framework to grayscale music scores. The proposed methodology achieves good results.",

While this information is widely available on the Web, it is most commonly published using proprietary Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The Linked Data community is aiming at resolving the incompatibilities between these diverse data sources by building a Web of data using Semantic Web technologies. The OMRAS2 project has made several important contributions to this by developing an ontological framework and numerous software tools, as well as publishing music related data on the Semantic Web. These data and tools have found their use even beyond their originally intended scope. In this paper, we first provide a broad overview of the Semantic Web technologies underlying this work. We describe the Music Ontology, an open-ended framework for communicating musical information on the Web, and show how this framework can be extended to describe specific sub-domains such as music similarity, content-based audio features, musicological data and studio production. We describe several data-sets that have been published and data sources that have been adapted using this framework. Finally, we provide application examples ranging from software libraries to end user Web applications.",

It contains a survey of previously proposed algorithms and suggests a new skeletonization-based approach. We define three different error metrics, compare the algorithms with respect to these metrics, and measure their robustness with respect to certain image defects. Our test images are computer-generated scores on which we apply various image deformations typically found in real-world data. In addition to modern western music notation, our test set also includes historic music notation such as mensural notation and lute tablature. Our general approach and evaluation methodology is not specific to staff removal but applicable to other segmentation problems as well.",

Preserving them entails their digitalization and consequent accessibility in a digital format easy-to-manage. The manual process to carry out this task is very time consuming and error prone. Optical music recognition (OMR) is a form of structured document image analysis where music symbols are isolated and identified so that the music can be conveniently processed. While OMR systems perform well on printed scores, current methods for reading handwritten musical scores by computers remain far from ideal. One of the fundamental stages of this process is the staff line detection. In this paper a new method for the automatic detection of music stave lines based on a shortest path approach is presented. Lines with some curvature, discontinuities, and inclination are robustly detected. The proposed algorithm behaves favourably when compared experimentally with well-established algorithms.",

Many images of music scores are now available, often mixed up with textual documents and images. For example, using the Google images search feature, a search for Beethoven will return a number of scores and manuscripts as well as pictures of the composer. In this paper we report on an investigation into methods to mechanically determine if a particular document is indeed a score, so that the user can specify that only musical scores should be returned. The goal is to find a minimal set of features that can be used as a quick test that will be applied to large numbers of documents. A variety of filters were considered, and two promising ones (run-length ratios and Hough transform) were evaluated. We found that a method based around run-lengths in vertical scans (RL) that out-performs a comparable algorithm using the Hough transform (HT). On a test set of 1030 images, RL achieved recall and precision of 97.8% and 88.4% respectively while HT achieved 97.8% and 73.5%.

                  "abstract": "Around 2000, many people realized that XML technology could be a great way to finally create a successful interchange format for music notation and digital sheet music applications. In the past, adoption of music notation interchange formats had suffered from both technical and social problems. Previous efforts like SMDL and NIFF never met their goals of becoming a standard music notation interchange format, even with the ISO 10743 seal of approval for SMDL. The major technical problem was to design a format that was complete enough for both commercial and academic use, while usable enough to be approachable for developers. The major social problem was how to get the format adopted by the market leaders in music notation editing, both of whom were inclined to keep to their proprietary formats. MusicXML overcame these technical and social problems to become the first successful interchange standard designed for music notation applications. As of December 2006, MusicXML works with over 60 music applications, including all the market leaders for music notation editing and scanning. None of the other XML formats for music notation interchange have been adopted by applications outside of their own organizations. Other application areas have similar adoption challenges, especially where market leaders might view a standard XML format as weakening a proprietary hold on customers. Examining how MusicXML overcame these technical and social barriers to become the de facto interchange standard for digital sheet music applications reveals some lessons that can be applied to other XML-based interchange formats:  Apply usability techniques to language design in the same way that you would to GUI design. Use terms that domain experts understand. Where possible, avoid introducing concepts that are specific to applications in the domain, rather than to the domain itself.  Develop the format together with software that reads and writes the format. Use evolutionary delivery to deliver early versions of both the format and the software, with frequent iterations to get both working well together. This particularly helps for meeting the twin goals of completeness and usability.  Make sure that the format can exchange data in both directions with at least one market leader in your application area. Do this as early as possible in your development process. Do not expect the market leaders to do this for you.  Market to other developers who would get a business benefit from using your format. This will be difficult until your format can exchange data with a market leader.  Give format developers good support. Involve the development community in the design of the format. Be responsive to developers who are using early versions of your format and translation software.  Avoid overhead. In a small market like music notation software, organizations like ISO and OASIS can be too costly in both time and money for even the largest industry players. Following the model of Adobes PDF format an open format under single company control can be more effective in these situations.",

These systems generally have two phases: recognizing the graphical symbols (such as noteheads and lines) and determining the musical meaning and relationships of the symbols (such as the pitch and rhythm of the notes). In this paper we explore the second phase and give a twostep approach that admits an economical representation of the parsing rules for the system. The approach is flexible and allows the system to be extended to new notations with little effortthe current system can parse common music notation, Sacred Harp notation and plainsong. It is based on a string grammar and a customizable graph that specifies relationships between musical objects. We observe that this graph can be related to printing as well as recognizing music notation, bringing the opportunity for crossfertilization between the two areas of research.

                  "abstract": "An adaptive optical music recognition system is being developed as part of an experiment in creating a comprehensive framework of tools to manage the workflow of large-scale digitization projects. This framework will support the path from physical object and/or digitized material into a digital library repository, and offer effective tools for incorporating metadata and perusing the content of the resulting multimedia objects. The project involves digitization of the Lester S. Levy Collection of Sheet Music (Milton S. Eisenhower Library, Johns Hopkins University). In Phase One, images of the music and lyrics, and color images of the covers of the Levy Collection were digitized and a database of text index records was created. Phase Two consists of converting the digitized music to computer-readable music notation format along with full-text lyrics, generating sound renditions, and creating metadata to enhance search capabilities. During Phase One, the researchers at the Eisenhower Library created a database of text index records, images of the music and lyrics and color images of the cover sheets from the Levy Collection. This database is available to the general public at http://levysheetmusic.mse.jhu.edu. Currently, the Collection can be searched in three modes. First, users can search by subject, a keyword search on the text record. Each of the pieces has been indexed for the subject of the song and/or cover image. Users may also browse the Collection by the topical arrangement of the physical collection. In Phase Two, an adaptive optical music recognition (AOMR) software (Fujinaga 1997) is used to convert the TIFF image of scanned sheet music into computer readable-formats, which includes GUIDO and MIDI files along with full-text of the lyrics. These digital objects will be deposited into the data repository along with the scanned sheet music TIFF, JPEG and thumbnail, and associated metadata. The AOMR software offers five important advantages over similar commercial offerings. First, it can be run in batch processing mode, an essential feature for the Levy Collection given its large number of music sheets. It is important to note that most commercial software is intended for the casual user and does not scale for a large number of objects. Second, the software is written in C and therefore is portable across platforms. Third, the software can learn to recognize different music symbolsan issue considering the diversity of the Levy Collection and the universe of notated music, in general. Fourth, the software is open-sourced. Finally, this software can separate full-text lyrics that can be further processed using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. The AOMR process is divided into two major sections: symbol classification and musical semantic interpretation. The first step in the interpretation phase is to connect all inter-related symbols. In addition, many rhythmic errors can also be corrected by adjusting the metric placement of notes relative to their vertical alignment with notes in other parts. An interactive graphic editor suitable to be interfaced with the AOMR program is being developed jointly with the group working on the GUIDO editor (Renz 2000). The purpose of this editor is to correct any errors generated by the AOMR so that the corrected version then can be converted to GUIDO format. To enable powerful search and retrieval as well as user-friendly navigational mechanism, Phase Two of the Levy Project will include a strong metadata component. Commonly defined as data about data, metadata is structured representational information. The kinds of metadata important for Levy include descriptive (to enable searching, browsing and identification of items), structural (to enable the creation of an interface for optimum browsing and navigation), and administrative (to manage the digital components of the collection and aid users in identification of items). To further enhance the scholarly value of the Levy Collection, a web interface will be developed for a music research toolkit, for example, Humdrum (Huron 1997). These toolkits are software tools intended to assist in music research and are suitable for use in a wide variety of computer-based musical investigations, such as motivic, stylistic, and melodic analysis and concordance studies. We also propose to extend plans for developing automated means of mining authoritative name information and creating even richer name indexes. The entire project is an experiment in developing a comprehensive framework of tools to manage the workflow of large-scale digitization projects. This framework will support the path from physical object and/or digitized material into a digital library repository, and offer effective tools for incorporating metadata and perusing the content of the resulting multimedia objects. The Levy Collection, with its large size and availability in digital format, is an ideal subject for development and evaluation of this proposed framework.",

Indeed there exists an important set of rules for musical notation, but current systems do not fully use them. We propose a new solution using a grammar to guide the segmentation of the graphical objects and their recognition. The grammar is essentially a description of the relations (relative position and size, adjacency, etc) between the graphical objects. Inspired by Deenite Clause Grammar techniques, the grammar can be directly implemented in Prolog, a higher-order dialect of Prolog. Moreover, the translation from the grammar into Prolog code can be done automatically. Our approach is justiied by the rst encouraging results obtained with a prototype for music score recognition.",

This work is concerned with producing M.R.L. data automatically from existing printed music scores. A review of work undertaken in the field of manipulating printed music by computer is provided. This shows that software which permits production of high-quality scores is commercially available, but the necessary data has to be entered using some form of keyboard, possibly in conjunction with a pointing device. It is desirable, for reasons detailed in this work, to be able to convert the musical information contained in the enormous quantity of existing music into computer-readable form. The only practical method for achieving this is via an automatic system. Such an automatic system must cope with the variations in format, content and print-quality of existing scores. Background material relating to previous work on pattern recognition of various types of binary image is included, with a section covering the subject of automatic recognition of printed music. An original system for automatic recognition of printed music developed by the author is described. This is designed to be widely applicable and hence is, in effect, omnifont and size-independent, with significant tolerance of noise, limited rotation, broken print and distortion. Numerous illustrations showing the application of the system are included, together with proposals for future areas of development.",

The nodes are subdivided into two sets: A. the nodes connected by the branches of set I, B. the remaining nodes (one and only one branch of set II will lead to each of these nodes), We start the construction by choosing an arbitrary node as the only member of set A, and by placing all branches that end in this node in set II. To start with, set I is empty. From then onwards we perform the following two steps repeatedly. Step 1. The shortest branch of set II is removed from this set and added to",

From this interpretivist position we explore the nature of visualization design study and develop six criteria for rigor. We propose that rigor is established and judged according to the extent to which visualization design study research and its reporting are INFORMED, REFLEXIVE, ABUNDANT, PLAUSIBLE, RESONANT, and TRANSPARENT. This perspective and the criteria were constructed through a four-year engagement with the discourse around rigor and the nature of knowledge in social science, information systems, and design. We suggest methods from cognate disciplines that can support visualization researchers in meeting these criteria during the planning, execution, and reporting of design study. Through a series of deliberately provocative questions, we explore implications of this new perspective for design study research in visualization, concluding that as a discipline, visualization is not yet well positioned to embrace, nurture, and fully benefit from a rigorous, interpretivist approach to design study. The perspective and criteria we present are intended to stimulate dialogue and debate around the nature of visualization design study and the broader underpinnings of the discipline.",

This increase in digital cultural heritage data promises new modes of analysis and increased levels of access for academic scholars and casual users alike. Going beyond the standard representations of search-centric and grid-based interfaces, a multitude of approaches has recently started to enable visual access to cultural collections, and to explore them as complex and comprehensive information spaces by the means of interactive visualizations. In contrast to conventional web interfaces, we witness a widening spectrum of innovative visualization types specially designed for rich collections from the cultural heritage sector. This new class of information visualizations gives rise to a notable diversity of interaction and representation techniques while lending currency and urgency to a discussion about principles such as serendipity, generosity, and criticality in connection with visualization design. With this survey, we review information visualization approaches to digital cultural heritage collections and reflect on the state of the art in techniques and design choices.

These flowfactors are navigation input, level of control, navigation progress, story layout, role of visualization, story progression, and navigation feedback. We also describe a series of studies we conducted, which shed initial light on how different visual narrative flows impact the reading experience. We report on two exploratory studies, in which we gathered reactions and preferences of readers for stepper vs. scrollerdriven flows. We then report on a crowdsourced study with 240 participants, in which we explore the effect of the combination of different flowfactors on readers engagement.

In digital collections, objects are prepared and presented particularly for the Web and the ambition is to provide the entirety of a physical collection. To make these rich and comprehensive data sets accessible, an explore mode is increasingly offered. The present study considers this mode, first by making sense of the term exploration and suggesting four functional principles in support of exploration in digital collections  view, movement, contextualization, and participation. On this basis, we compare eight well-known museums with regard to the explore modes for their digital collections. We have devised a three-part methodology, reverse information architecture , to address the question: How is the function of exploration manifested in the structure and interface elements of digital collections? With this unique method we use the given content to investigate how far the four principles are implemented in explore modes of digital collections and, broadly said, how explorable they are. The introduced approach to studying digital collections could be opened up to other fields to analyze a variety of Web interfaces in general.",

With regards to the specific character of cultural heritage at the intersection of research, education, and public interest, the presented visualization environment aims at meeting the requirements of both researchers as well as a broader public. We present the results from a collaborative interdisciplinary research project that involved a cultural heritage foundation, art historians, designers, and computer scientists. The case study examines the potential of visualization when applied to, and developed for, cultural heritage collections. It specifically explores how techniques aimed at visualizing the quantitative structure of a collection can be coupled with a more qualitative mode that allows for detailed examination of the artifacts and their contexts by displaying high-resolution views of digitized cultural objects with detailed art historical research findings. Making use of latest web technologies, the resulting visualization environment allows for dynamic filtering and zooming of a collection of visual resources that are arranged along a contextualized timeline. We share insights from our collaborative design process and the feedback and usage data gathered during the deployment of the resulting prototype as a web application. We end with a discussion of transferability of carefully crafted and collaboratively negotiated visualizations of cultural heritage and raise questions concerning the applicability of our approach to related strands of humanities research.

While InfoVis has become a buzz topic in the digital humanities, skepticism remains about how effectively it integrates into and expands on traditional humanities research approaches. From an InfoVis perspective, we lack case studies that show the specific design challenges that make literary studies and humanities research at large a unique application area for information visualization. We examine these questions through our case study of the Speculative W@nderverse, a visualization tool that was designed to enable the analysis and exploration of an untapped literary collection consisting of thousands of science fiction short stories. We present the results of two empirical studies that involved general-interest readers and literary scholars who used the evolving visualization prototype as part of their research for over a year. Our findings suggest a design space for visualizing literary collections that is defined by (1) their academic and public relevance, (2) the tension between qualitative vs. quantitative methods of interpretation, (3) result-vs. process-driven approaches to InfoVis, and (4) the unique material and visual qualities of cultural collections. Through the Speculative W@nderverse we demonstrate how visualization can bridge these sometimes contradictory perspectives by cultivating curiosity and providing entry points into literary collections while, at the same time, supporting multiple aspects of humanities research processes.",

                  "abstract": "Decades of digitisation have made a wealth of digital cultural material available online. Yet search  the dominant interface to these collections  is incapable of representing this abundance. Search is ungenerous: it withholds information, and demands a query. This paper argues for a more generous alternative: rich, browsable interfaces that reveal the scale and complexity of digital heritage collections. Drawing on related work and precedents from information retrieval and visualisation, as well as critical humanistic approaches to the interface, this paper documents and analyses practical experiments in generous interfaces developed in collaboration with Australian cultural institutions. Imagine yourself outside an art gallery in a far-off city, with a collection you dont know well. You enter the building to find a small, drab lobby with an attendant at a desk. The attendant asks you to enter your query on a small slip of paper. Not knowing the collection, and not seeking anything in particular, you write down something arbitrary, and pass it over. The attendant disappears for a moment before returning with a line of artworks sitting on trolleys. These are paraded, ten at a time, through the lobby. You can submit another query at any time, calling forth more trolleys, but there seems to be no way to explore the gallery beyond this small lobby. As absurd as it seems, this scenario is played out daily on the web sites of libraries, archives, galleries and museums around the world, where keyword search is the central  often the only  way to access the collection. The dichotomy embodied here can be framed through the notion of generosity. Decades of digitisation have made a wealth of digital cultural material available online. The Victoria and Albert Museum offers over a million items; Europeanas aggregated collection numbers some 31 million; the National Library of Australias Trove hosts around 128 million digitised newspaper articles. A recent survey of some 1200 institutions in the UK and Europe found that 80% have digitised collections, and these are increasingly coming online [ENUMERATE 2014]. This is a truly generous mass: large, abundant, ample. Yet in response to this abundance, collection interfaces wheel out miserly lists, one page at a time. Generosity entails more than scale, too: another of its senses describes an ethos of giving or sharing freely. These values tally well with the aims of many collecting institutions  especially public institutions, mandated to provide broad and open access. But here too, search is ungenerous. It fails to be liberal in sharing: instead of throwing open the doors, its greeting is Yes, what? As an interface, search fails to match the ample abundance of our digital collections and the generous ethos of the institutions that hold them. A more generous interface would do more to represent the scale and richness of its collection. It would open the doors, tear down the drab lobby; instead of demanding a query it would offer multiple ways in, and support exploration as well as the focused enquiry where search excels. In revealing the complexity of digital collections, a generous interface would also enrich interpretation by revealing relationships and structures within a collection. This is not to question the effectiveness of search or its value for many users. Empirical research shows that many visitors come to a museum website seeking specific information [Fantoni et al. 2012]. However, a significant number of visitors do not have a specific goal: in a survey of the motivations of some 34,000 visitors to Dutch museum websites, 29% report seeking specific information, but 21% visit to engage in casual browsing [INTK n.d.]. Another recent study finds that browse features are valued highly by non-expert visitors to online art collections [Lopatovska et al. 2013]. Thus from the users perspective, search is an incomplete solution. In this context, more generous interfaces are beginning to emerge. The sites of the Rijksmuseum> and the Walker Art Centre, for example, emphasise browsing and visual exploration. While the Victoria and Albert Museums collections page privileges search, it also generously includes a random sampling of works.

                  "abstract": "Interactive visual applications often rely on animation to transition from one display state to another. There are multiple animation techniques to choose from, and it is not always clear which should produce the best visual correspondences between display elements. One major factor is whether the animation relies on staggering-an incremental delay in start times across the moving elements. It has been suggested that staggering may reduce occlusion, while also reducing display complexity and producing less overwhelming animations, though no empirical evidence has demonstrated these advantages. Work in perceptual psychology does show that reducing occlusion, and reducing inter-object proximity (crowding) more generally, improves performance in multiple object tracking. We ran simulations confirming that staggering can in some cases reduce crowding in animated transitions involving dot clouds (as found in, e.g., animated 2D scatterplots). We empirically evaluated the effect of two staggering techniques on tracking tasks, focusing on cases that should most favour staggering. We found that introducing staggering has a negligible, or even negative, impact on multiple object tracking performance. The potential benefits of staggering may be outweighed by strong costs: a loss of common-motion grouping information about which objects travel in similar paths, and less predictability about when any specific object would begin to move. Staggering may be beneficial in some conditions, but they have yet to be demonstrated. The present results are a significant step toward a better understanding of animation pacing, and provide direction for further research.",

                  "abstract": "Interactive visualization provides valuable support for exploring, analyzing, and understanding textual documents. Certain tasks, however, require that insights derived from visual abstractions are verified by a human expert perusing the source text. So far, this problem is typically solved by offering overview-detail techniques, which present different views with different levels of abstractions. This often leads to problems with visual continuity. Focus-context techniques, on the other hand, succeed in accentuating interesting subsections of large text documents but are normally not suited for integrating visual abstractions. With VarifocalReader we present a technique that helps to solve some of these approaches problems by combining characteristics from both. In particular, our method simplifies working with large and potentially complex text documents by simultaneously offering abstract representations of varying detail, based on the inherent structure of the document, and access to the text itself. In addition, VarifocalReader supports intra-document exploration through advanced navigation concepts and facilitates visual analysis tasks. The approach enables users to apply machine learning techniques and search mechanisms as well as to assess and adapt these techniques. This helps to extract entities, concepts and other artifacts from texts. In combination with the automatic generation of intermediate text levels through topic segmentation for thematic orientation, users can test hypotheses or develop interesting new research questions. To illustrate the advantages of our approach, we provide usage examples from literature studies.",

With the ever increasing amounts and complexity of data, the demand for systems to help with these comparisons is also growing. Increasingly, information visualization tools support such comparisons explicitly, beyond simply allowing a viewer to examine each object individually. In this paper, we argue that the design of information visualizations of complex objects can, and should, be studied in general, that is independently of what those objects are. As a first step in developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related to comparison. Although we find a great diversity of systems and approaches, we see that all designs are assembled from the building blocks of juxtaposition, superposition and explicit encodings. This initial exploration shows the power of our model, and suggests future challenges in developing a general understanding of comparative visualization and facilitating the development of more comparative visualization tools.",

There are many possible reasons for this skewed balance between the visual and interactive aspects of a visualization. One reason is that interaction is an intangible concept that is difficult to design, quantify, and evaluate. Unlike for visual design, there are few examples that show visualization practitioners and researchers how to design the interaction for a new visualization in the best manner. In this article, we attempt to address this issue by collecting examples of visualizations with best-in-class interaction and using them to extract practical design guidelines for future designers and researchers. We call this concept fluid interaction, and we propose an operational definition in terms of the direct manipulation and embodied interaction paradigms, the psychological concept of flow, and Normans gulfs of execution and evaluation.",

These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observerindependent and certain, rather than observer codependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a codependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observerindependent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.",

                  "abstract": "A common goal in graph visualization research is the design of novel techniques for displaying an overview of an entire graph. However, there are many situations where such an overview is not relevant or practical for users, as analyzing the global structure may not be related to the main task of the users that have semi-specific information needs. Furthermore, users accessing large graph databases through an online connection or users running on less powerful (mobile) hardware simply do not have the resources needed to compute these overviews. In this paper, we advocate an interaction model that allows users to remotely browse the immediate context graph around a specific node of interest. We show how Furnas original degree of interest function can be adapted from trees to graphs and how we can use this metric to extract useful contextual subgraphs, control the complexity of the generated visualization and direct users to interesting datapoints in the context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an exploration of a dense online database containing over 3 million legal citations.",

We review and categorize these schemes according to the interface mechanisms used to separate and blend views. The four approaches are overview+detail, which uses a spatial separation between focused and contextual views; zooming, which uses a temporal separation; focus+context, which minimizes the seam between views by displaying the focus within the context; and cue-based techniques which selectively highlight or suppress items within the information space. Critical features of these categories, and empirical evidence of their success, are discussed. The aim is to provide a succinct summary of the state-of-the-art, to illuminate both successful and unsuccessful interface strategies, and to identify potentially fruitful areas for further work.",

                  "abstract": "Graphics have been used since ancient times to portray things that are inherently spatiovisual, like maps and building plans. More recently, graphics have been used to portray things that are metaphorically spatiovisual, like graphs and organizational charts. The assumption is that graphics can facilitate comprehension, learning, memory, communication and inference. Assumptions aside, research on static graphics has shown that only carefully designed and appropriate graphics prove to be beneficial for conveying complex systems. Effective graphics conform to the Congruence Principle according to which the content and format of the graphic should correspond to the content and format of the concepts to be conveyed. From this, it follows that animated graphics should be effective in portraying change over time. Yet the research on the efficacy of animated over static graphics is not encouraging. In cases where animated graphics seem superior to static ones, scrutiny reveals lack of equivalence between animated and static graphics in content or procedures; the animated graphics convey more information or involve interactivity. Animations of events may be ineffective because animations violate the second principle of good graphics, the Apprehension Principle, according to which graphics should be accurately perceived and appropriately conceived. Animations are often too complex or too fast to be accurately perceived. Moreover, many continuous events are conceived of as sequences of discrete steps. Judicious use of interactivity may overcome both these disadvantages. Animations may be more effective than comparable static graphics in situations other than conveying complex systems, for example, for real time reorientations in time and space.",

To this end, we are developing a new computer interface model called Pad. The ongoing Pad project uses a spatial metaphor for computer interface design. It provides an intuitive base for the support of such applications as electronic marketplaces, information services, and on-line collaboration. Pad is an infinite two dimensional information plane that is shared among users, much as a network file system is shared. Objects are organized geographically; every object occupies a well defined region on the Pad surface. For navigation, Pad uses portals - magnifying glasses that can peer into and roam over different parts of this single infinite shared desktop; links to specific items are established and broken continually as the portals view changes. Portals can recursively look onto other portals. This paradigm enables the sort of peripheral activity generally found in real physical working environments. The apparent size of an object to any user determines the amount of detail it presents. Different users can share and view multiple applications while assigning each a desired degree of interaction. Documents can be visually nested and zoomed as they move back and forth between primary and secondary working attention. Things can be peripherally accessible. In this paper we describe the Pad interface. We discuss how to efficiently implement its graphical aspects, and we illustrate some of our initial applications.",

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical course of patients with moderate AS with evidence of concomitant heart failure manifesting as elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Methods: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study of 332 patients with elevated BNP. 165 patients with moderate AS were compared with 167 controls with none-mild AS. The Median follow-up duration was 3.85 years. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause hospitalizations and all-cause mortality. Results: BNP levels were 530 and 515 pg/mL in the study and the control groups, respectively. Moderate AS had significantly higher rates of primary composite endpoint in both univariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.141.97; p=0.004) and adjusted analysis (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.052.01; p=0.02). Moderate AS had 1.41 (95% CI, 1.18 1.69; p<0.001) times more all-cause hospitalization per patient-year of follow-up compared to controls in the univariate model. After adjustment for significant covariates, moderate AS remained an independent predictor of all-cause hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.181.79; p=0.005). Furthermore, moderate AS was significantly associated with higher all-cause hospitalization rates in both heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (IRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.021.75; p=0.038) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [IRR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.031.67; p=0.026). Conclusions: Moderate AS in conjunction with elevated BNP portends a significantly worse prognosis than those without moderate AS and should be followed closely.",

Even when individuals receive professional care, assessments are intermittent and may be limited partly due to the episodic nature of psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, machinelearning technology using speech samples obtained in the clinic or remotely could one day be a biomarker to improve diagnosis and treatment. To date, reviews have only focused on using acoustic features from speech to detect depression and schizophrenia. Here, we present the first systematic review of studies using speech for automated assessments across a broader range of psychiatric disorders. Methods We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We included studies from the last 10years using speech to identify the presence or severity of disorders within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM5). For each study, we describe sample size, clinical evaluation method, speecheliciting tasks, machine learning methodology, performance, and other relevant findings. Results 1395 studies were screened of which 127 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were on depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and the remaining on posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. 63% of studies built machine learning predictive models, and the remaining 37% performed nullhypothesis testing only. We provide an online database with our search results and synthesize how acoustic features appear in each disorder. Conclusion Speech processing technology could aid mental health assessments, but there are many obstacles to overcome, especially the need for comprehensive transdiagnostic and longitudinal studies. Given the diverse types of datasets, feature extraction, computational methodologies, and evaluation criteria, we provide guidelines for both acquiring data and building machine learning models with a focus on testing hypotheses, open science, reproducibility, and generalizability.

The analysis of extended speech production is a precious source of information encompassing the phonetic, phonological, lexico-semantic, morpho-syntactic, and pragmatic levels of language organization. The knowledge about the distinctive linguistic variables identifying language deficits associated to different neurodegenerative diseases has progressively improved in the last years. However, the heterogeneity of such variables and of the way they are measured and classified limits any generalization and makes the comparison among studies difficult. Here we present an exhaustive review of the studies focusing on the linguistic variables derived from the analysis of connected speech samples, with the aim of characterizing the language disorders of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including primary progressive aphasia, Alzheimers disease, movement disorders, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A total of 61 studies have been included, considering only those reporting group analysis and comparisons with a group of healthy persons. This review first analyzes the differences in the tasks used to elicit connected speech, namely picture description, story narration, and interview, considering the possible different contributions to the assessment of different linguistic domains. This is followed by an analysis of the terminologies and of the methods of measurements of the variables, indicating the need for harmonization and standardization. The final section reviews the linguistic domains affected by each different neurodegenerative disease, indicating the variables most consistently impaired at each level and suggesting the key variables helping in the differential diagnosis among diseases. While a large amount of valuable information is already available, the review highlights the need of further work, including the development of automated methods, to take advantage of the richness of connected speech analysis for both research and clinical purposes.",

The World Health Organization estimates 16 million pertussis cases annually worldwide resulting in over 200,000 deaths. It is prevalent mainly in developing countries where it is difficult to diagnose due to the lack of healthcare facilities and medical professionals. Hence, a low-cost, quick and easily accessible solution is needed to provide pertussis diagnosis in such areas to contain an outbreak. In this paper we present an algorithm for automated diagnosis of pertussis using audio signals by analyzing cough and whoop sounds. The algorithm consists of three main blocks to perform automatic cough detection, cough classification and whooping sound detection. Each of these extract relevant features from the audio signal and subsequently classify them using a logistic regression model. The output from these blocks is collated to provide a pertussis likelihood diagnosis. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using audio recordings from 38 patients. The algorithm is able to diagnose all pertussis successfully from all audio recordings without any false diagnosis. It can also automatically detect individual cough sounds with 92% accuracy and PPV of 97%. The low complexity of the proposed algorithm coupled with its high accuracy demonstrates that it can be readily deployed using smartphones and can be extremely useful for quick identification or early screening of pertussis and for infection outbreaks control.",

A method for the characterization of the speech signals, based on the automatic segmentation of utterances into voiced and unvoiced frames, is addressed here. The energy content of the unvoiced sounds is modeled using 12 Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and 25 bands scaled according to the Bark scale. Four speech tasks comprising isolated words, rapid repetition of the syllables /pa/-/ta/-/ka/, sentences, and read texts are evaluated. The method proves to be more accurate than classical approaches in the automatic classification of speech of people with PD and healthy controls. The accuracies range from 85% to 99% depending on the language and the speech task. Cross-language experiments are also performed confirming the robustness and generalization capability of the method, with accuracies ranging from 60% to 99%. This work comprises a step forward for the development of computer aided tools for the automatic assessment of dysarthric speech signals in multiple languages.",

The aim of the current study was to explore the possible occurrence of phonatory abnormalities in prodromal HD. Method Sustained vowel phonations were acquired from 28 premanifest HD individuals and 28 healthy controls of comparable age. Data were analysed acoustically for measures of several phonatory dimensions including airflow insufficiency, aperiodicity, irregular vibration of vocal folds, signal perturbations, increased noise, vocal tremor and articulation deficiency. A predictive model was built to find the best combination of acoustic features and estimate sensitivity/specificity for differentiation between premanifest HD subjects and controls. The extent of voice deficits according to a specific phonatory dimension was determined using statistical decision making theory. The results were correlated to global motor function, cognitive score, disease burden score and estimated years to disease onset. Results Measures of aperiodicity and increased noise were able to significantly differentiate between premanifest HD individuals and controls (p<0.01). The combination of these aspects of dysphonia led to a sensitivity of 91.5% and specificity of 79.2% to correctly distinguish speakers with premanifest HD from healthy individuals. Some form of disrupted phonatory function was revealed in 68% of our premanifest HD subjects, where 18% had one affected phonatory dimension and 50% showed impairment of two or more dimensions. A relationship between pitch control and cognitive score was also observed (r=0.50, p=0.007). Conclusions Phonatory abnormalities are detectable even the in premotor stages of HD. Speech investigation may have the potential to provide functional biomarkers of HD and could be included in future clinical trials and therapeutic interventions.",

Vowels were extracted from sustained phonation, sentence repetition, reading passage, and monologue. Acoustic analysis was based upon measures of the first (F1) and second (F2) formant of the vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/, vowel space area (VSA), F2i/F2u and vowel articulation index (VAI). Parkinsonian speakers manifested abnormalities in vowel articulation across F2u, VSA, F2i/F2u, and VAI in all speaking tasks except sustained phonation, compared to 15 age-matched healthy control participants. Findings suggest that sustained phonation is an inappropriate task to investigate vowel articulation in early PD. In contrast, monologue was the most sensitive in differentiating between controls and PD patients, with classification accuracy up to 80%. Measurements of vowel articulation were able to capture even minor abnormalities in speech of PD patients with no perceptible dysarthria. In conclusion, impaired vowel articulation may be considered as a possible early marker of PD. A certain type of speaking task can exert significant influence on vowel articulation. Specifically, complex tasks such as monologue are more likely to elicit articulatory deficits in parkinsonian speech, compared to other speaking tasks.",

Building on recent work in noise robust automatic speech recognition, we model events as a linear combination of dictionary atoms, and mixtures as a linear combination of overlapping events. The weights of activated atoms in an observation serve directly as evidence for the underlying event classes. The atoms in the dictionary span multiple frames and are created by extracting all possible fixed-length exemplars from the training data. To combat data scarcity of small training datasets, we propose to artificially augment the amount of training data by linear time warping in the feature domain at multiple rates. The method is evaluated on the Office Live and Office Synthetic datasets released by the AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events.",

We first perform classification experiments focusing on the automatic detection of PD as a 2-class problem (PD vs. healthy speakers). The detection of severity is described as a 3-class task based on the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) ratings. We employ acoustic, prosodic and glottal features on different kinds of speech tests: various syllable repetition tasks, read sentences and texts, and monologues. Classification is performed in either case by SVMs. We report recognition results of 81.9 % when trying to differentiate between normally speaking persons and speakers with PD.

Recently, a wide range of speech signal processing algorithms (dysphonia measures) aiming to predict PD symptom severity using speech signals have been introduced. In this paper, we test how accurately these novel algorithms can be used to discriminate PD subjects from healthy controls. In total, we compute 132 dysphonia measures from sustained vowels. Then, we select four parsimonious subsets of these dysphonia measures using four feature selection algorithms, and map these feature subsets to a binary classification response using two statistical classifiers: random forests and support vector machines. We use an existing database consisting of 263 samples from 43 subjects, and demonstrate that these new dysphonia measures can outperform state-of-the-art results, reaching almost 99% overall classification accuracy using only ten dysphonia features. We find that some of the recently proposed dysphonia measures complement existing algorithms in maximizing the ability of the classifiers to discriminate healthy controls from PD subjects. We see these results as an important step toward noninvasive diagnostic decision support in PD.",

At present, UPDRS is determined by the subjective clinical evaluation of the patients ability to adequately cope with a range of tasks. In this study, we extend recent findings that UPDRS can be objectively assessed to clinically useful accuracy using simple, self-administered speech tests, without requiring the patients physical presence in the clinic. We apply a wide range of known speech signal processing algorithms to a large database (approx. 6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multi-centre trial) and propose a number of novel, nonlinear signal processing algorithms which reveal pathological characteristics in PD more accurately than existing approaches. Robust feature selection algorithms select the optimal subset of these algorithms, which is fed into non-parametric regression and classification algorithms, mapping the signal processing algorithm outputs to UPDRS. We demonstrate rapid, accurate replication of the UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 2 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians estimates, p < 0.001). This study supports the viability of frequent, remote, cost-effective, objective, accurate UPDRS telemonitoring based on self-administered speech tests.

For event detection, the system performs recognition and temporal positioning of a sequence of events. An accuracy of 24% was obtained in classifying isolated sound events into 61 classes. This corresponds to the accuracy of classifying between 61 events when mixed with ambient background noise at 0dB signal-to-noise ratio.

Understanding the nature and course of dysarthria in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is important because loss of communication prevents patients from participating in many activities, may lead to social isolation, and reduces the quality of life. The goal of management of dysarthria in ALS patients is to optimize communication effectiveness for as long as possible. The information about dysarthria in ALS is dispersed in physiological, pathological, speech therapy, otorhinolaringological and neurological publications. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on the clinical features, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, investigations and management of dysarthria in ALS patients.

We introduce a new measure of dysphonia, pitch period entropy (PPE), which is robust to many uncontrollable confounding effects including noisy acoustic environments and normal, healthy variations in voice frequency. We collected sustained phonations from 31 people, 23 with PD. We then selected ten highly uncorrelated measures, and an exhaustive search of all possible combinations of these measures finds four that in combination lead to overall correct classification performance of 91.4%, using a kernel support vector machine. In conclusion, we find that nonstandard methods in combination with traditional harmonics-to-noise ratios are best able to separate healthy from PD subjects. The selected nonstandard methods are robust to many uncontrollable variations in acoustic environment and individual subjects, and are thus well suited to telemonitoring applications.",

However, in comparison to related speech processing tasks such as Automatic Speech and Speaker Recognition, practically no standardised corpora and test-conditions exist to compare performances under exactly the same conditions. Instead a multiplicity of evaluation strategies employed  such as cross-validation or percentage splits without proper instance definition  prevents exact reproducibility. Further, in order to face more realistic scenarios, the community is in desperate need of more spontaneous and less prototypical data. This INTERSPEECH 2009 Emotion Challenge aims at bridging such gaps between excellent research on human emotion recognition from speech and low compatibility of results. The FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus [1] serves as basis with clearly defined test and training partitions incorporating speaker independence and different room acoustics as needed in most reallife settings.

This paper offers an overview of the set of features, related, among others, to timbre, tonality, rhythm or form, that can be extracted with the MIRtoolbox.

Also the same syntax can be used for analyses of single audio files, batches of files, series of audio segments, multi-channel signals, etc. For that purpose, the data and methods of the toolbox are organised in an object-oriented architecture. 1 MOTIVATION AND APPROACH MIRtoolbox is a Matlab toolbox dedicated to the extraction of musically-related features from audio recordings. It has been designed in particular with the objective of enabling the computation of a large range of features from databases of audio files, that can be subjected to statistical analyses. Few softwares have been proposed in this area. One particularity of our own approach relies in the use of the Matlab computing environment, which offers good visualisation capabilities and gives access to a large variety of other toolboxes. In particular, the MIRtoolbox makes use of functions available in public-domain toolboxes such as the Auditory Toolbox [6], NetLab [5] and SOMtoolbox [10]. Other toolboxes, such as the Statistics toolbox or the Neural Network toolbox from MathWorks, can be directly used for further analyses of the features extracted c  2007 Austrian Computer Society (OCG). by MIRtoolbox without having to export the data from one software to another. Such computational framework, because of its general objectives, could be useful to the research community in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), but also for educational purposes. For that reason, particular attention has been paid concerning the ease of use of the toolbox. In particular, complex analytic processes can be designed using a very simple syntax, whose expressive power comes from the use of an object-oriented paradigm. The different musical features extracted from the audio files are highly interdependent: in particular, as can be seen in figure 1, some features are based on the same initial computations. In order to improve the computational efficiency, it is important to avoid redundant computations of these common components. Each of these intermediary components, and the final musical features, are therefore considered as building blocks that can been freely articulated one with each other. Besides, in keeping with the objective of optimal ease of use of the toolbox, each building block has been conceived in a way that it can adapt to the type of input data. For instance, the computation of the MFCCs can be based on the waveform of the initial audio signal, or on the intermediary representations such as spectrum, or mel-scale spectrum (see Fig. 1). Similarly, autocorrelation is computed for different range of delays depending on the type of input data (audio waveform, envelope, spectrum). This decomposition of all feature extraction algorithms into a common set of building blocks has the advantage of offering a synthetic overview of the different approaches studied in this domain of research. 2 FEATURE EXTRACTION 2.1 Feature overview Figure 1 shows an overview of the main features implemented in the toolbox.

MOTIVATION AND APPROACH MIRToolbox is a Matlab toolbox dedicated to the extraction of musically-related features from audio recordings. It has been designed in particular with the objective of enabling the computation of a large range of features from databases of audio files, that can be applied to statistical analyses. Few softwares have been proposed in this area. The most important one, Marsyas [1], provides a general architecture for connecting audio, soundfiles, signal processing blocks and machine learning (see section 5 for more details). One particularity of our own approach relies in the use of the Matlab computing environment, which offers good visualisation capabilities and gives access to a large variety of other toolboxes. In particular, the MIRToolbox makes use of functions available in recommended public-domain toolboxes such as the Auditory Toolbox [2], NetLab [3], or SOMtoolbox [4]. Other toolboxes, such as the Statistics toolbox or the Neural Network toolbox from MathWorks, can be directly used for further analyses of the features extracted by MIRToolbox without having to export the data from one software to another.

FEATURE EXTRACTION 2.1. Feature overview Figure 1 shows an overview of the main features implemented in the toolbox. All the different processes start from the audio signal (on the left) and form a chain of operations proceeding to right. The vertical disposition of the processes indicates an increasing order of complexity of the operations, from simplest computation (top) to more detailed auditory modelling (bottom). Each musical feature is related to one of the musical dimensions traditionally defined in music theory. Boldface characters highlight features related to pitch, to tonality (chromagram, key strength and key Self-Organising Map, or SOM) and to dynamics (Root Mean Square, or RMS, energy). Bold italics indicate features related to rhythm, namely tempo, pulse clarity and fluctuation. Simple italics highlight a large set of features that can be associated to timbre. Among them, all the operators in grey italics can be in fact applied to many others different representations: for instance, statistical moments such as centroid, kurtosis, etc., can be applied to either spectra, envelopes, but also to histograms based on any given feature. One of the simplest features, zero-crossing rate, is based on a simple description of the audio waveform itself: it counts the number of sign changes of the waveform. Signal energy is computed using root mean square, or RMS [5]. The envelope of the audio signal offers timbral characteristics of isolated sonic event. FFT-based spectrum can be computed along the frequency domain or along Mel-bands, with linear or decibel energy scale, and",

We briefly review Hochreiters (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.",

Four differing algorithms for the reduction of the CF of complex multitone signals are compared with each other by computer simulation.

Asymmetric, tremulous onset was most common, although 23% of patients had no rest tremor. Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias occurred in 60% of levodopa-treated patients. All patients had clinical parkinsonism; however, 12 had atypical clinical features of Parkinsons disease, including severe early dementia, fluctuating confusional states, no response to levodopa, and early marked autonomic disturbance. Neuropathologic examination found coexistent Alzheimer-type change in 17 cases and striatal abnormality--mainly vascular--in 34 cases. Cortical Lewy bodies were present in all cases, but only four satisfied proposed criteria for diffuse Lewy body disease. Dementia occurred in 44% of cases; 29% had Alzheimers disease, 10% had numerous cortical Lewy bodies, and 6% had a possible vascular cause; in 55% no definite pathologic cause was found. Nigral cell loss correlated with disease duration and severity.

Our proposed visualization allows for dynamically defining person groups to be visually compared on different zoom levels. We designed the visualization in cooperation with musicologists having multifaceted research interests on a biographical database of musicians. On the one hand, we enable deriving new relationships between musicians in order to extend the underlying database, and on the other hand, our visualization supports analyzing time-dependent changes of musical institutions.

In a storytelling context where the intent is to convey multiple narrative points, a richer set of timeline designs may be more appropriate than the narrow range that has been used for exploratory data analysis by the research community. Informed by a survey of 263 timelines, we present a design space for storytelling with timelines that balances expressiveness and effectiveness, identifying 14 design choices characterized by three dimensions: representation, scale, and layout. Twenty combinations of these choices are viable timeline designs that can be matched to different narrative points, while smooth animated transitions between narrative points allow for the presentation of a cohesive story, an important aspect of both interactive storytelling and data videos. We further validate this design space by realizing the full set of viable timeline designs and transitions in a proof-of-concept sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven example timeline stories.

Methods  Data was harvested from MARC metadata found in the library catalogue for a special collection of Saskatchewan music at the University of Saskatchewan. Microsoft Excel and OpenRefine were used to screen, clean, and enhance the dataset. Data was imported into ArcGIS software, where it was plotted using a geo-visualization showing location and concentrations of musical activity by large ensembles within the province. The geo-visualization also allows users to filter results based on the ensemble type (band, orchestra, or choir).  Results  The geo-visualization shows that albums from large community ensembles appear across the province, in cities and towns of all sizes. The ensembles are concentrated in the southern portion of the province and there is a correlation between population density and ensemble location. Choral ensembles are more prevalent than bands and orchestras, and appear more widely across the province, whereas bands and orchestras are concentrated around larger centres.  Conclusions  Library catalogue data contains unique information for research based on special collections, though additional cleaning is needed. Using geospatial visualizations to navigate collections allows for more intuitive searching by location, and allow users to compare facets. While not appropriate for all kinds of searching, maps are useful for browsing and for location-based searches. Information is displayed in a visual way that allows users to explore and connect with other platforms for more information.",

However, as a consequence of its growth, it is increasingly difficult to follow the growing body of literature within the field. Survey papers and literature reviews are valuable tools for managing the great volume of previously published research papers, and the quantity of survey papers in visualization has reached a critical mass. To this end, this survey paper takes a quantum step forward by surveying and classifying literature survey papers in order to help researchers understand the current landscape of Information Visualization. It is, to our knowledge, the first survey of survey papers (SoS) in Information Visualization. This paper classifies survey papers into natural topic clusters which enables readers to find relevant literature and develops the first classification of classifications. The paper also enables researchers to identify both mature and less developed research directions as well as identify future directions. It is a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers in and outside the field of Information Visualization and Visual Analytics.",

We categorize and analyze this bottom-up input, and contrast it with the previously published research challenges based on five research agenda papers (top-down). We observe certain overlaps but also some interesting differences between the top-down and bottom-up approaches. A synthesis of the two suggests three major issues as persistent challenges: (1) a better understanding of the scope of our domain, how it interacts with other domains, and how to make this happen, (2) a systematic understanding of human factors, (3) a practicable set of guidelines that matches the visualization types to task types, and guides the practitioner to design geovisualizations that are appropriate and helpful to the user. Distinguishing persistent from important, we discuss why the identified challenges are persistent, and draw recommendations for action based on our observations and interpretations. We believe these findings will help building a stronger, better-grounded research agenda for our community.",

                  "abstract": "This project uses network graphs to depict musicians careers in late seventeenth-century Venice. The current network graph, viewable on the Musicians in Venice web page, demonstrates relationships between musicians and the institutions that employed them. The graph is bimodal, with nodes representing musicians (people nodes) and institutions (place nodes). Archival texts are incorporated into the visualization, with transcriptions of records that indicate musicians activity included in the node attributes. The entire project is text-based, with data derived from XML transcriptions of archival records in addition to assigned metadata. The current website is a proof of concept for a larger project that would demonstrate ways of displaying text as part of the network graph and using texts in creating network visualizations. The current graph focuses on the career of the composer Giovanni Legrenzi. Legrenzi worked for several prominent Venetian institutions from the early 1670s to his death in 1690 and ultimately was appointed to the most prestigious musical posts in the city. The musicians he worked with also served multiple institutions, either simultaneously or in succession, and their relationships with other musicians, patrons, and administrators often facilitated their movement between institutions. Legrenzis Venetian career presents an excellent case study of these musical connections in late seventeenth-century Venice, and studying these connections demonstrates how networks of musicians functioned in this time period. This study also provides a representative sample of how network visualization effectively demonstrates patterns in musicians careers in Venice. The texts in the network graph include transcribed administrative documents, mostly unpublished, from the Venetian institutions where Legrenzi was active between 1670 and 1690. These are primarily payment, hiring, and termination records, which document the activity of the musicians employed by or affiliated with these institutions. Several generations of musicologists have used these documents to identify where different musicians were working, when they were employed, and in what capacity (Bonta, 1964; Moore, 1981; Termini, 1981; and Selfridge-Field, 1994). In this sense, this treatment of the documents is standard to the field, but applies DH methodology and processes to create visual representations the data. This provides a new perspective on the sources. For instance, grouping the person nodes by centrality results in multiple sub-groups, and proximity among these nodes demonstrates shared institutions and implied communities. (Hanneman and Riddle, 2005: Chapter 10) (Mary Russell Mitfords text-based network analysis of Robert Southeys Thalaba the Destroyer provides an excellent example of this. In addition to demonstrating the behavior of agile, well-connected nodes, the graph displays modules of nodes as units of analysis (Wasserman and Faust, 1994: 4).",

                  "abstract": "As opposed to the former idea of creative autonomy, in recent years, humanities research tends to investigate cultural contexts and circumstances, inspirational models, and the ways that knowledge, experience and expertise have been transferred over time. We address the question of creative transfer within the field of music. Due to the everlasting significance of musical works, relationships between musicians  the entry point for such an investigation  are well documented in archives, libraries and museums. In print media, usually only a single relation between two musicians is narrated. Furthermore, it is common for the biography of only one of the two musicians to report on the relationship. Larger overviews of social networks between several musicians seldom exist. Although some digital resources exist, these are often reduced to the milieux of popular musicians like Mozart and Beethoven. Since 2005, musicologists of the project Bavarian Musicians Encyclopedia Online (Bayerisches Musiker Lexikon Online, BMLO) have systematically collected biographical data (an example is given in Figure 1) and examined relationships between musicians from print media  a tedious work that results in a unique database of great value for musicology. The BMLO contains musicians from all kinds of musical professions (e.g., composers, singers, musicologists, instrument makers, ...), most of whom had an active lifetime period living in Bavaria or a considerable influence on Bavaria. Now providing information about around 28,000 musicians, the BMLO has achieved global scope, one that is underpinned by the many musicologists worldwide who use the BMLO for their daily work. Figure 1: Biographical information about Robert Schumann in the BMLO. Alongside information about a musicians lifetime, denomination, professions or places of activity, the database provides a number of relationships by type. Next to his partner Clara Schumann, further relations are listed to Robert Schumanns father in law, to his students, colleagues, and other acquainted musicians in his social network",

                  "abstract": "A music piece contains a large amount of information represented as a series of instructions corresponding to notes that must be played at specific times. These simple notes are combined to form complex harmonic structures that can be difficult to identify and analyze. Due to its simplicity and straightforward interpretation, music sheets and piano rolls have been the visual metaphor employed by most music visualization tools to support interpretation. Albeit it can represent all necessary elements to perform a music piece, these metaphors do not explicitly show many of the patterns and structures inherent to music arrangements, such as rhythm progression and harmonic interactions, needing users to create a mental model of them. Moreover, comparing different pieces and visualizing how a particular instrument track relates to the others is an issue not only for music sheet-based techniques, but also for most existing music visualization methods. In this paper, we present a novel visualization framework, called Music Overview, Stability, and Harmony Visualization (MoshViz), which facilitates the visualization and understanding of music renditions, focusing mainly on the visual analysis of specific musical instruments. Our approach creates a high-level model of music data and highlights structures of interest, enabling a detail+overview visualization to assist users in the task of identifying harmonic and melodic patterns. The usefulness and representativeness of MoshViz are confirmed by a set of user tests which demonstrate that the proposed visual metaphor matches, with a high degree of accuracy, the mental model of different users regarding the recognizable patterns of sounds.",

In music, the plagiarism is a very common phenomenon which touch the vast amounts of money that music melodies are able to generate in todays pop music market. In a music composition, the melody is assumed to be the most significant factor in a courts decision about whether a new music composition is an illegitimate version of a pre-existing composition. Despite the wide-spread belief that there is a fixed and trivial number of corresponding notes between two melodies, the similarity analysis is a very complex process. In this paper we address the plagiarism in pop music, and specifically, we study whether visualization can facilitate the task of discovering melodic similarities among musical songs. To investigate this, we defined three representations to show the melodic relations among songs. We performed a user study in which subjects performed different tasks on a song collection using these representations to investigate which one is best in terms of intuitiveness and accuracy.

Motivated by previous literature that found evidence for connections between personality and music consumption and preference, we first assessed in a user study to which extent personality traits and music visualization preferences correlate. Measuring preference via pragmatic quality and personality traits according to the Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire, we found substantial interconnections between them. These translate into rules relating certain personality traits (e.g., extraversion or agreeableness) to preference rankings of the visualizations. In the proposed personality-based system, users are grouped into four clusters according to their answers to the most significant personality questions determined in the study. The order of the visualizations for a given user is adapted with respect to the ranking preferred by other users in the same cluster. Evaluation of the system was carried out by a second user study that showed a significantly higher normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) for the personalized system in comparison to a system with randomized order of the visualizations.",

Typically, in the ICU, body composition is assessed through anthropometrics or bioelectrical impedance analysis, but these modalities cannot specifically quantify skeletal muscle; thus, we evaluate the merits and challenges of using computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography to specifically measure skeletal muscle in the ICU. Recent findingsCT-based cut points have been used to identify critically ill patients with low muscle mass, and low muscularity associates with poor clinical outcomes and function. Ultrasonography is emerging as a useful tool to quantify skeletal muscle loss and degradation in architecture, as well as prospectively track changes in these parameters over time. Rates of muscle atrophy and changes in muscle architecture has been quantified by ultrasonography and associated with poor clinical outcomes, but identification of critically ill patients with low muscularity is still in its infancy. SummaryCT imaging and ultrasonography require additional comprehensive validations against accurate measures of whole body muscle mass. As these validations begin to emerge, there will be a need to translate this knowledge into a simple tool that clinicians can apply as part of routine care.",

Threedimensional visualization technology (3DVT) has been advanced as a promising tool to enhance anatomy knowledge. The purpose of this review is to conduct a metaanalysis of the effectiveness of 3DVT in teaching and learning anatomy compared to all teaching methods. The primary outcomes were scores of anatomy knowledge tests expressed as factual or spatial knowledge percentage means. Secondary outcomes were perception scores of the learners. Thirtysix studies met the inclusion criteria including 28 (78%) randomized studies. Based on 2,226 participants including 2,128 from studies with comparison groups, 3DVTs (1) resulted in higher (d=0.30, 95%CI: 0.020.62) factual knowledge, (2) yielded significant better results (d=0.50, 95%CI: 0.200.80) in spatial knowledge acquisition, and (3) produced significant increase in user satisfaction (d=0.28, 95%CI=0.120.44) and in learners perception of the effectiveness of the learning tool (d=0.28, 95%CI=0.140.43). The total mean scores (out of five) and SDs for QUESTSs Quality and Strength dimensions were 4.38 (SD 1.3) and 3.3 (SD 1.7), respectively. The results have high internal validity, for the improved outcomes of 3DVTs compared to other methods of anatomy teaching. Given that anatomy teaching and learning in the modern medical school appears to be approaching a crisis, 3DVT can be a potential solution to the problem of inadequate anatomy pedagogy.

                  "abstract": "When visualizing data with uncertainty, a common approach is to treat uncertainty as an additional dimension and encode it using a visual variable. The effectiveness of this approach depends on how the visual variables chosen for representing uncertainty and other attributes interact to influence the users perception of each variable. We report a user study on the perception of graph edge attributes when uncertainty associated with each edge and the main edge attribute are visualized simultaneously using two separate visual variables. The study covers four visual variables that are commonly used for visualizing uncertainty on line graphical primitives: lightness, grain, fuzziness, and transparency. We select width, hue, and saturation for visualizing the main edge attribute and hypothesize that we can observe interference between the visual variable chosen to encode the main edge attribute and that to encode uncertainty, as suggested by the concept of dimensional integrality. Grouping the seven visual variables as color-based, focus-based, or geometry-based, we further hypothesize that the degree of interference is affected by the groups to which the two visual variables belong. We consider two further factors in the study: discriminability level for each visual variable as a factor intrinsic to the visual variables and graph-task type (visual search versus comparison) as a factor extrinsic to the visual variables. Our results show that the effectiveness of a visual variable in depicting uncertainty is strongly mediated by all the factors examined here. Focus-based visual variables (fuzziness, grain, and transparency) are robust to the choice of visual variables for encoding the main edge attribute, though fuzziness has stronger negative impact on the perception of width and transparency has stronger negative impact on the perception of hue than the other uncertainty visual variables. We found that interference between hue and lightness is much greater than that between saturation and lightness, though all three are color-based visual variables. We also found a compound relationship between discriminability level and the degree of dimensional integrality. We discuss the generalizability and limitation of the results and conclude with design considerations for visualizing graph uncertainty derived from these results, including recommended choices of visual variables when the relative importance of data attributes and graph tasks is known.",

The book consists of eight chapters. The first two cover foundations of music representations and the Fourier transformconcepts that are then used throughout the book. In the subsequent chapters, concrete music processing tasks serve as a starting point. Each of these chapters is organized in a similar fashion and starts with a general description of the music processing scenario at hand before integrating it into a wider context. It then discussesin a mathematically rigorous wayimportant techniques and algorithms that are generally applicable to a wide range of analysis, classification, and retrieval problems. At the same time, the techniques are directly applied to a specific music processing task. By mixing theory and practice, the books goal is to offer detailed technological insights as well as a deep understanding of music processing applications. Each chapter ends with a section that includes links to the research literature, suggestions for further reading, a list of references, and exercises. The chapters are organized in a modular fashion, thus offering lecturers and readers many ways to choose, rearrange or supplement the material. Accordingly, selected chapters or individual sections can easily be integrated into courses on general multimedia, information science, signal processing, music informatics, or the digital humanities.",

In this work we define a two-level color-based approach, that exploits graphical visualization techniques to represent data structures of classical music, and to perform harmonic analysis of musical compositions. Our main goal is to make easier and very quick the study of classical notations (recognized as a tedious and difficult task in the field), by providing individuals with a mechanism that clarifies complex relationships in music using visual clues. We performed a preliminary study to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach as well as participants perceptions about its usefulness and pleasantness.

In an effort to display different facets of a graph, such a wealth of visualization techniques has been developed in the past that current surveys focus on a single additional facet only in order to enumerate and classify them. This report builds on existing graph visualization surveys for the four common facets of partitions, attributes, time, and space. It contributes a generic high-level categorization of faceted graph visualization that subsumes the existing classifications, which can be understood as facet-specific refinements of the resulting categories. Furthermore, it extends beyond existing surveys by applying the same categorization to graph visualizations with multiple facets. For each of the introduced categories and considered facets, this overview provides visualization examples to illustrate instances of their realization.",

This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and flexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-specific problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our typology and over two dozen extant classification systems and theoretical frameworks from the literatures of visualization, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, communications, and cartography.",

Songrium also features a social annotation framework to verbalize and share various relations among songs, and a flexible ranking mechanism to find interesting songs. After we launched Songrium in August 2012, more than 7,000 users have used our service in which over 98,000 songs and 520,000 derivative works have automatically been registered.

They are also more complex for the audience to understand, due to the diversity of their components and the magical aspect of the musicians actions when compared to acoustic instruments. This complexity results in a loss of liveness and possibly a poor experience for the audience. Our approach, called Rouages, is based on a mixed-reality display system and a 3D visualization application. Rouages reveals the mechanisms of digital musical instruments by amplifying musicians gestures with virtual extensions of the sensors, by representing the sound compo- nents with 3D shapes and specific behaviors and by showing the impact of musicians gestures on these components. In its current implementation, it focuses on MIDI controllers as input devices. We believe that Rouages opens up new perspectives for instrument makers and musicians to improve audience experience with their digital musical instruments.",

First, a typology of uncertainty is used to delineate kinds of uncertainty matched with space, time, and attribute components of data. Second, concepts from visual semiotics are applied to characterize the kind of visual signification that is appropriate for representing those different categories of uncertainty. This framework guided the two experiments reported here. The first addresses representation intuitiveness, considering both visual variables and iconicity of representation. The second addresses relative performance of the most intuitive abstract and iconic representations of uncertainty on a map reading task. Combined results suggest initial guidelines for representing uncertainty and discussion focuses on practical applicability of results.",

Heavy metal nanoparticles as such are excellent absorber of Xrays and can offer excellent improvement in medical diagnosis and Xray imaging. Substantial progress has been made in the synthesis protocol and characterization studies of these materials but a major challenge still lies in the toxicological studies, which are rather incomplete. The worst known cases were those associated with Thorotrast (suspension of ThO2 nanoparticles) which resulted in many deaths over years. Properly protected nanomaterials conjugated or coated with biocompatible materials can be used for the fabrication of various functional systems with multimodality, targeting properties, reduced toxicity and proper removal from the body.

M usic  beyond the scores, recordings and signal analysis that occupies information scientists and music librarians  has the amazing ability to bring human history to life. The ethos of a time and place is inevitably reflected by the humanities, and music is no exception. We know this effect through our own personal experiences: the way couples have their song, the way music takes you back to a time in a different place, the soundtrack of car radios, movies and television shows that accompany us through various life stages. For many music scholars the socio-cultural aspect of music is an important part of their research. However, current conceptualization of music research within digital humanities does not fully address the socio-cultural element in music research. Efforts within the digital humanities are focused primarily on music as either information or artifact. While the elements of music such as pitch and rhythm are common to all music researchers to various degrees, it is not fully representative of the diverse approaches that music research can take [1]. Conceptualization of what constitutes music within digital humanities is necessarily narrow as we experiment with different applications of technologies to support music research.Yet, as I will suggest in this short piece, a broader conceptualization of music is necessary for digital humanities research in the domain of music to have real impact on music scholarship.",

Our research group developed a piano learning system to support correct keying and fingering for beginners. However, the system did not support the learning of rhythm. Rhythm consists of various kinds of note and rest, and it is difficult for beginners, who are not used to reading a score, to understand the different duration of each note and rest. Alternatively, there are piano roll scores, which describe timing of keying and releasing clearly, but which do not teach players how to read a musical staff. Therefore, the goal of our study is to construct a piano learning support system that considers rhythm. We discuss methods of effectively indicating information for piano performance, such as rhythm information, while teaching how to read a musical staff. We have developed a prototype system, and evaluated its effectiveness through actual use of the system. We found that it had significant advantages over a piano roll method.",

However, high precision projection methods are either computationally expensive or not flexible enough to enable feedback from user interaction into the projection process. A builtin mechanism that dynamically adapts the projection based on direct user intervention would make the technique more useful for a larger range of applications and data sets. In this paper we propose the Piecewise Laplacianbased Projection (PLP), a novel multidimensional projection technique, that, due to the local nature of its formulation, enables a versatile mechanism to interact with projected data and to allow interactive changes to alter the projection map dynamically, a capability unique of this technique. We exploit the flexibility provided by PLP in two interactive projectionbased applications, one designed to organize pictures visually and another to build music playlists. These applications illustrate the usefulness of PLP in handling highdimensional data in a flexible and highly visual way. We also compare PLP with the currently most promising projections in terms of precision and speed, showing that it performs very well also according to these quality criteria.",

By applying techniques from information visualization to this problem, we were able to provide average people with a detailed and powerful tool for accessing their own musical past. LastHistory is an interactive visualization for displaying music listening histories, along with contextual information from personal photos and calendar entries. Its two main user tasks are (1) analysis, with an emphasis on temporal patterns and hypotheses related to musical genre and sequences, and (2) reminiscing, where listening histories and context represent part of ones past. In this design study paper we give an overview of the field of music listening histories and explain their unique characteristics as a type of personal data. We then describe the design rationale, data and view transformations of LastHistory and present the results from both a laband a large-scale online study.

We focus on visualizing harmonic relationships between tones and colours. Related existing visualizations map tones or keys into a discrete set of colours. As concurrent (simultaneous) tones are not perceived as entirely separate, but also as a whole, we present a novel method for visualizing a group of concurrent tones (limited to the pitches of the 12-tone chromatic scale) with one colour for the whole group. The basis for calculation of colour is the assignment of key spanning circle of thirds to the colour wheel. The resulting colour is not limited to discrete set of colours: similar tones, chords and keys have similar colour hue; dissonance and consonance are represented by low and high colour saturation respectively. The proposed method is demonstrated as part of our prototype music visualization system using extended 3-dimensional piano roll notation.",

                  "abstract": "In modern times, music video (MV) has become an important favorite pastime to people because of its conciseness, convenience, and the ability to bring both audio and visual experiences to audiences. As the amount of MVs is explosively increasing, it has become an important task to develop new techniques for effective MV analysis, retrieval, and management. By stimulating the human affective response mechanism, affective video content analysis extracts the affective information contained in videos, and, with the affective information, natural, user-friendly, and effective MV access strategies could be developed. In this paper, a novel integrated system (i.MV) is proposed for personalized MV affective analysis, visualization, and retrieval. In i.MV, we not only perform the personalized MV affective analysis, which is a challenging and insufficiently covered problem in current affective content analysis field, but also propose novel affective visualization to convert the abstract affective states intuitive and friendly to users. Based on the affective analysis and visualization, affective information based MV retrieval is achieved. Both comprehensive experiments and subjective user studies on a large MV dataset demonstrate that our personalized affective analysis is more effective than the previous algorithms. In addition, affective visualization is proved to be more suitable for affective information-based MV retrieval than the commonly used affective state representation strategies.",

Depicting such preferences in a condensed and easily understandable way is very appealing, especially considering the current trends in social network communication. In this paper we propose a method to automatically generate, given a provided set of preferred music tracks, an iconic representation of a users musical preferences -- the Musical Avatar. Starting from the raw audio signal we first compute over 60 low-level audio features. Then, by applying pattern recognition methods, we infer a set of semantic descriptors for each track in the collection. Next, we summarize these track-level semantic descriptors, obtaining a user profile. Finally, we map this collection-wise description to the visual domain by creating a humanoid cartoony character that represents the users musical preferences. We performed a proof-of-concept evaluation of the proposed method on 11 subjects with promising results. The analysis of the users evaluations shows a clear preference for avatars generated by the proposed semantic descriptors over avatars derived from neutral or randomly generated values. We also found a general agreement on the representativeness of the users musical preferences via the proposed visualization strategy.",

These relationships are plotted between artists using a new timeline-based visualization where a node in a traditional node-link diagram has been transformed into a Timeline-Node, which allows the visualization of an evolving entity over time, such as the membership in a band.

                  "abstract": "The steep rise in music downloading over CD sales has created a major shift in the music industry away from physical media formats and towards online products and services. Music is one of the most popular types of online information and there are now hundreds of music streaming and download services operating on the World-Wide Web. Some of the music collections available are approaching the scale of ten million tracks and this has posed a major challenge for searching, retrieving, and organizing music content. Research efforts in music information retrieval have involved experts from music perception, cognition, musicology, engineering, and computer science engaged in truly interdisciplinary activity that has resulted in many proposed algorithmic and methodological solutions to music search using content-based methods. This paper outlines the problems of content-based music information retrieval and explores the state-of-the-art methods using audio cues (e.g., query by humming, audio fingerprinting, content-based music retrieval) and other cues (e.g., music notation and symbolic representation), and identifies some of the major challenges for the coming years.",

                  "abstract": "Various lifelike computer characters have been proposed in recent years [LCC94, LCC95]. In this paper, we introduce an innovative way of using a lifelike computer character to enhance the human-human and human-computer communication. We propose an interactive performance system in which a virtual CG dancer enables two players (musicians) to interact with each other not only through music but also through 3-D computer animation. The players not only improvise together as in a conventional jam session, but also observe the virtual dancer, whose motion is changed in real time according to their musical performance. In other words, they can communicate using both auditory information and visual information. The purpose of this research is to achieve a new mode of interaction in which CG and music are closely integrated by a lifelike computer character. Interaction between a player and a lifelike computer character through musical performance was reported [Goto, 1993], but interaction between players was not considered in those reports. In real jam sessions, musical interaction between players is essential and is achieved by exchanging not only auditory information but also auxiliary visual information such as gestures that indicate repetition or the end of song. To enhance the visual interaction in a jam session and provide players with more expressive way to communicate, we introduce a virtual dancer called Cindy visible to both players. Two players, a drummer and a guitarist (or pianist), can choreograph Cindy together by their musical improvisation in real time. The players can use three kinds of interaction at the same time: 1) interaction between the players through their musical sounds, 2) interaction between each player and Cindy, 3) interaction between the players through Cindy. The first interaction is the musical interaction of a conventional jam session, and the second interaction is both direct and indirect. In the direct interaction the drummer determines the timing of a Cindys motion, since each drum-sound is directly mapped to a Cindys motion. There are six predefined sets of mappings between seven kinds of drum-sounds and Cindys motions, each for a different mood of dance motions. In the indirect interaction the guitarist switches these mapping sets by changing a mood of his musical improvisation. If the guitarist plays, Cindy does not move unless the drummer determines the motion timing; information from both players is necessary to choreograph the dance totally. The third interaction, cooperation between the two players, is therefore important in creating a complete performance. This lifelike computer character system has been implemented on distributed workstations connected by the Ethernet. MIDI data of two players performance is sent to a graphics workstation that displays Cindy and to a workstation that controls a MIDI instrument that produces sounds. In our experimental setup, the three kinds of interaction were performed on the system, and the multimodal interaction produced very satisfactory results.",

Most temporal visualisations, however, only represent discrete data points or single data types along a single timeline: this event started here and ended there; this work was published at this time; this tag was popular for this period. In order to represent richer, faceted attributes of temporal events, we present Continuum. Continuum enables hierarchical relationships in temporal data to be represented and explored; it enables relationships between events across periods to be expressed, and in particular it enables user-determined control over the level of detail of any facet of interest so that the person using the system can determine a focus point, no matter the level of zoom over the temporal space. We present the factors motivating our approach, our evaluation and implementation of this new visualisation which makes it easy for anyone to apply this interface to rich, large-scale datasets with temporal data.",

A demand for active music listening has recently emerged. If the drum parts of popular songs could be manipulated, listeners could have new musical experiences by freely changing their impressions of the pieces (e.g., making the drum performance more energetic)instead of passively listening to them. To achieve this, Drumix provides three functions for rearranging drum parts, i.e., a volume control function that enables users to cut or boost the volume of each drum with a drum-specific volume slider, a timbre change function that allows them to replace the original timbre of each drum with another selected from a drop-down list, and a drum-pattern editing function that enables them to edit repetitive patterns of drum onsets on a graphical representation of their scores. Special musical skills are not required to use these functions. Subjective experiments revealed that Drumix could add a new dimension to the way listeners experience music.",

This allows visual data mining in standard directory listings of window-based operating systems. The icons consist of bloom-like shapes, whose form and color depend on eight parameters. These parameters are controlled through a neural net, the input of which are audio features that are extracted algorithmically from the MP3 files. To adapt the system to the users perception and interests, the neural net is initially trained with a small set of songs and icons.

Given an arbitrary collection of digital music files, our system creates a virtual landscape which allows the user to freely navigate in this collection. This is accomplished by automatically extracting features from the audio signal and training a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) on them to form clusters of similar sounding pieces of music. Subsequently, a Smoothed Data Histogram (SDH) is calculated on the SOM and interpreted as a three-dimensional height profile. This height profile is visualized as a three-dimensional island landscape containing the pieces of music. While moving through the terrain, the closest sounds with respect to the listeners current position can be heard. This is realized by anisotropic auralization using a 5.1 surround sound model. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge extracted automatically from the web to enrich the landscape with semantic information. More precisely, we display words and related images that describe the heard music on the landscape to support the exploration.",

                  "abstract": "This paper describes a method for obtaining a list of repeated chorus (hook) sections in compact-disc recordings of popular music. The detection of chorus sections is essential for the computational modeling of music understanding and is useful in various applications, such as automatic chorus-preview/search functions in music listening stations, music browsers, or music retrieval systems. Most previous methods detected as a chorus a repeated section of a given length and had difficulty identifying both ends of a chorus section and dealing with modulations (key changes). By analyzing relationships between various repeated sections, our method, called RefraiD, can detect all the chorus sections in a song and estimate both ends of each section. It can also detect modulated chorus sections by introducing a perceptually motivated acoustic feature and a similarity that enable detection of a repeated chorus section even after modulation. Experimental results with a popular music database showed that this method correctly detected the chorus sections in 80 of 100 songs. This paper also describes an application of our method, a new music-playback interface for trial listening called SmartMusicKIOSK , which enables a listener to directly jump to and listen to the chorus section while viewing a graphical overview of the entire song structure. The results of implementing this application have demonstrated its usefulness",

To this end, we use the page counts provided by Google to estimate the relatedness of an arbitrary artist to each of a set of genres. We investigate four different query schemes for obtaining the page counts and two different probabilistic approaches for predicting the genre of a given artist. Evaluation is performed on two test collections, a large one with a quite general genre taxonomy and a quite small one with rather specific genres. Since our approach yields estimates for the relatedness of an artist to every genre of a given genre set, we can derive genre distributions which incorporate information about artists that cannot be assigned a single genre. This allows us to overcome the inflexible artist-genre assignment usually used in music information systems. We present a simple method to visualize such genre distributions with our Travellers Sound Player. Finally, we briefly outline how to adapt the presented approach to extract other properties of music artists from the web.",

However, current research in the design of user interfaces for the exploration of music collections has mainly focused on visualization aspects ignoring possible benefits from spatialized music playback. We describe our first development steps towards two novel user-interface designs: The Sonic Radar arranges a fixed number of prototypes resulting from a content-based clustering process in a circle around the users standpoint. To derive an auralization of the scene, we introduce the concept of an aural focus of perception that adapts well-known principles from the visual domain. The Sonic SOM is based on Kohonens SelfOrganizing Map. It helps the user in understanding the structure of his music collection by positioning titles on a two-dimensional grid according to their high-dimensional similarity. We show how our auralization concept can be adapted to extend this visualization technique and thereby support multimodal navigation.",

Low level audio features are extracted from the raw audio data on short time windows during which the sound is assumed to be stationary. Static and temporal statistics were consistently and systematically used for aggregation of low level features to form high level features. A supervised feature selection targeted to model perceptual distance between different sounding music lead to a small set of non-redundant sound features. Clustering and visualization based on these feature vectors can discover emergent structures in collections of music. Visualization based on Emergent Self-Organizing Maps in particular enables the unsupervised discovery of timbrally consistent clusters that may or may not correspond to musical genres and artists. We demonstrate the visualizations capabilities of the U-Map, displaying local sound differences based on the new audio features. An intuitive browsing of large music collections is offered based on the paradigm of topographic maps. The user can navigate the sound space and interact with the maps to play music or show the context of a song.",

We demonstrate our approach on a data set containing 224 artists from 14 genres and evaluate the results using the rank correlation between the prototypicality ranking and a ranking obtained by page counts of search queries to Google that contain artist and genre. High positive rank correlations are achieved for nearly all genres of the data set. Furthermore, we elaborate a visualization method that illustrates similarities between artists using the prototypes of all genres as reference points.

The maps are visualized using an Islands of Music metaphor where islands represent groups of similar pieces. The maps are linked to each other using a new technique to align self-organizing maps. The user is able to browse the collection and explore different aspects by gradually changing focus from one view to another.

In this paper a novel user interface to browse and navigate through music on small devices is proposed, together with the enabling algorithms. The goal of this interface is to enable the users to explore and discover their entire collection and to support nonspecific searches. To this end, a new way to visualize and navigate through music is introduced: the artist map. The artist map is designed to provide an overview of an entire music collection, or a subset thereof, by clearly visualizing the similarity between artists, computed from the music itself. Contextual information (e.g. mood, genre) is added by coloring and by attribute magnets. The artist map is implemented by a graph-drawing algorithm, which uses an improved energy model. The proposed algorithm and interface have been implemented in a prototype and will be tested with real users.",

The previous decades of performance research have yielded a large number of very detailed studies analyzing various parameters of expressive music performance (see Palmer 1997 and Gabrielsson 1999 for an overview). A special focus was given to expressive piano performance, because the expressive parameters are relatively few (timing, dynamics, and articulation, including pedaling) and comparatively easy to obtain. The majority of performance studies concentrated on one of these parameters exclusively, and in most of these cases, this parameter was expressive timing. In our everyday experience, we never listen to one of these parameters in isolation as it is analyzed in performance research. Certainly, the listeners attention can be guided sometimes more to one particular parameter (e.g., the forced stable tempo in a Proko eff Toccata or the staccato legato alternation in a Mozart Allegro), but generally the aesthetic impression of a performance results from an integrated perception of all performance parameters and is in uenced by other factors like body movements and the socio-cultural background of a performer or a performance as well. It can be presumed that the different performance parameters in uence and depend on each other in various and intricate ways. (For example, Todd 1992 and Juslin, Friberg, and Bresin 2002 provide modeling-based approaches.) Novel research methods could help us to analyze expressive music performances in a more holistic way to tackle these questions. Another problem of performance analysis is the enormously large amounts of information the researcher must deal with, even when investigating, for example, only the timing of a few bars of a single piece. In general, it remains unclear whether the expressive deviations measured are due to deliberate expressive strategies, musical structure, motor noise, imprecision of the performer, or even measurement errors. In the present article, we develop an integrated analysis technique in which tempo and loudness are processed and displayed at the same time. Both the tempo and loudness curves are smoothed with a window size corresponding ideally to the length of a bar. These two performance parameters are then displayed in a two-dimensional performance space on a computer screen: a dot moves in synchrony with the sound of the performance. The trajectory of its tail describes geometric shapes that are intrinsically different for different performances. Such an animated display seems to be a useful visualization tool for performance research. The simultaneous display of tempo and loudness allows us to study interactions between these two parameters by themselves or with respect to properties of the musical score. The behavior of the algorithm and insights provided by this type of display are illustrated with performances of two musical excerpts by Chopin and Schubert. In the  rst case study, two expert performances and a professional recording by Maurizio Pollini are compared; in the second case study, an algorithmic performance according to a basic performance model is contrasted by Alfred Brendels performance of the same excerpt. These two excerpts were chosen because articulation is constant throughout the whole excerpt (legato), and analysis can concentrate on tempo and dynamics.",

Several visualization techniques have been developed to study the cluster structure of data, i.e., the existence of distinctive groups in the data and how these clusters are related to each other. However, only few of these techniques lend themselves to studying how this structure changes if the features describing the data are changed. Understanding this relationship between the features and the cluster structure means understanding the features themselves and is thus a useful tool in the feature extraction phase.In this paper we present a novel approach to visualizing how modification of the features with respect to weighting or normalization changes the cluster structure.

While artist-based listings or title indexes may help in locating a specific piece of music, a more intuitive, genre-based organization is required to allow users to browse an archive and explore its contents. So far, however, these organizations following musical styles have to be designed manually. With the SOM-enhanced JukeBox (SOMeJB) we propose an approach to automatically create an organization of music archives following their perceived sound similarity. More specifically, characteristics of frequency spectra are extracted and transformed according to psychoacoustic models. The resulting psychoacoustic Rhythm Patterns are further organized using the Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map, an unsupervised neural network. On top of this advanced visualizations including Islands of Music (IoM) and Weather Charts offer an interface for interactive exploration of large music repositories.",

                  "abstract": "In this article, a heuristic version of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) named is used for audio retrieval and browsing. , like MDS, maps objects into an Euclidean space, such that similarities are preserved. In addition of being more efficient than MDS it allows query-by-example type of query, which makes it suitable for a content-based retrieval purposes. 1. INTRODUCTION The origin of this experiment is the research on a system for contentbased audio identification. Details on the system are described in [1]. Basically the system decomposes songs into sequences of an alphabet of sounds, very much like speech can be decomposed into phonemes. Once having converted the audio into sequences of symbols, the identification problem results in finding subsequences in a superstring allowing errors, that is, approximate string matching. If we compare one sequencecorresponding to an original song in the databaseto the whole database of sequences we retrieve a list of sequences sorted by similarity to the query. In the context of an identification system, this list reflects which songs the querya distorted version of an original recording [1]can be more easily confused with. Of course, studying this for each song is a tedious task and it is difficult to extract information on the matching results for the whole database against itself. Indeed, the resulting distances displayed in a matrix are not very informative at first sight. One possible way to explore these distances between songs by mere visual inspection is Multidimensional Scaling. MDS makes it possible to view a database of complex objects as points in an Euclidean space where the distances between points correspond approximately to the distances between objects. This plot helps to discover some structure in the data in order to study methods to accelerate the song matching search. It can also be used as a test environment to compare different audio parameterization as well as their corresponding intrinsic distances independently of the metrics. Finally, FastMaps indexing capabilities also provide an interesting tool for content-based browsing and retrieval of songs. 2. RELATED WORK Research projects that offer visual interfaces for browsing are the [2] and ! #  [3]. The uses sonic spatialization for navigating music or sound databases. In [2] melodies are represented as objects in a space. By adding direct sonification, the user can explore this space visually and aurally with a new kind of cursor function that creates an aura around the cursor. All melodies within the aura are played concurrently using spatialized sound. The authors present distances for melodic similarity but they acknowledge the difficulty to represent the melodic distances in an Euclidean space. ! #  is a prototype audio browser and editor for large audio collections. It shares some concepts with the % &  ( and integrates them in an extended Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page. ) * 2002 IRCAM Centre Pompidou audio editor. To solve the problem of reducing dimensionality and mapping objects into 2D or 3D spaces, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed. The drawback of this solution is that the object must be a vector of features and, consequently, it does not allow the use of e.g: the edit distance, the inclusion of metadata or other arbitrary distance metrics. In this article, the use of MDS, specifically is proposed to address this issue. 3. MAPPING COMPLEX OBJECTS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACES 3.1 Multidimensional Scaling MDS [5] is used to discover the underlying (spatial) structure of a set of data from the similarity, or dissimilatity, information among them. It has been used for some years in e.g. social sciences, psychology, market research, physics. Basically the algorithm projects each object to a point in a k-dimensional space trying to minimize the + ,.-/ +0+ function: + ,.-/ +0+ 1 333 4 5 687 9&: = 6 9@(A 5 687 9 = A 6 9 where = 6 9 is the dissimilarity measure between the original objects and ; = 6 9 is the Euclidean distance between the projections. The +<,.-/ +0+ function gives the relative error that the distances in k-dimensional space suffer from, on average. The algorithm starts assigning each item to a point in the space, randomly or using some heuristics. Then, it examines each point, computes the distances from the other points and moves the point to minimize the discrepancy between the actual dissimilarities and the estimated distances in the Euclidean space. As described in [4], the MDS suffers from two drawbacks: B It requires C : D A @ time, where D is the number of items. It is therefore impractical for large datasets. B If used in a query by example search, each query item has to be mapped to a point in the k-dimensional space. MDS is not well-suited for this operation: Given that the MDS algorithm is C : D A @ , an incremental algorithm to search/add a new item in the database would be C : D @ at best. 3.2 FastMap To overcome these drawbacks, Faloutsos and Lin [4] propose an alternative implementation of the MDS: . considers the objects as points of some unknown k-dimensional space. The points are iteratively projected to the hyperplanes perpendicular to an orthogonal set of k-lines passing through the most dissimilar objects. The algorithm is faster than MDS (being linear, as opposed to quadratic, w.r.t. the database), while it additionally allows indexing. They pursue fast searching in multimedia databases: mapping objects into points in k-dimensional spaces, they subsequently use highly fine-tuned spatial access methods (SAMs) to answer several types of queries, including the Query by Example type. They aim at two benefits: efficient retrieval, in conjunction with a SAM, as discussed above, visualization and data-mining. On the Use of FastMap for Audio Retrieval and Browsing 4. RESULTS To evaluate the performance of both least squares MDS and E F , we used a test bed consisting of 2 data collections. One collection consists in 1840 commercial songs and the second collection in 250 isolated instrument sounds (from IRCAMs Studio OnLine). Several dissimilarity matrices were calculated with different distance metrics. The results of these experiments are shown in detail in G 8 H JI KLK M M ONP FQ NPQ 0R N SK&TU WV K V &QX RY . In Figure 1 the representation of the song collection as points calculated with MDS and is shown. The MDS map takes considerably longer to calculate than the s (894 vs 18.4 seconds) although several runs of are sometimes needed to achieve good visualizations. Although we did not objectively evaluate and MDS (objective evaluations of data representation techniques are discussed in [5]), MDS maps seem of higher quality. On the other hand, MDS presents a high computational cost and does not account for the indexing/retrieval capabilities of the approach. 5. CONCLUSIONS We have presented the use of the existing method for improving a content-based audio identification system. The tool proves to be interesting, not only for audio fingerprinting research (visually exploring the representation space of audio data may reveal the possible weakness of a similarity measure), but also as a component of a search-enabled audio browser. We first tested the tool with audio objects such as harmonic or percussive isolated sounds for which perceptually-derived distances exist. In this case the results are excellent. But songs have a more complex nature, they account for many aspects of interest. Not only good similarity measures are hard to design but also to extract automatically from low-level audio features. Song repositories are usually described with heterogeneous mixes of attributes, descriptors range from physical feature vectors (e.g. MFCCs), up to subjective labels defined by experts (e.g. the genre). The advantage of MDS and Z lies in their generality: they can combine any type of data attributes, from low-level attributes to metadata. We believe that this feature is relevant for improving browsing engines. 6. REFERENCES [1] P. Cano, E. Batlle, H. Mayer, and H. Neuschmied.

The graphical interface displays the input data and the computed beat times, and allows the user to add, delete and adjust the beat times and then automatically re-track the remaining data based on the user input. The system also provides audio feedback consisting of the original input data accompanied by a percussion instrument sounding at the computed beat times. At the heart of the system is a beat tracking algorithm which estimates tempo based on the frequency of occurrence of the various time durations between pairs of note onset times, and then uses a multiple hypothesis search to find the sequence of note onsets that best matches one of the possible tempos. The primary application of this system is in the analysis of tempo and timing in musical performance, although the beat tracking algorithm itself has been shown to perform at least as well as other state-of-the-art systems.",

                  "abstract": "The downloadable sheet music market has been constrained by reliance on proprietary binary formats. MusicXML is a new Internet-friendly format for representing sheet music and music notation. We introduce the basics of MusicXML design, using examples from current software to illustrate MusicXMLs advantages over previous music interchange formats. We conclude by discussing the new types of music use that MusicXML makes possible, and how this fits in with ongoing XML development efforts. 1. The Need for a New Music Interchange Format Common Western music notation is a symbolic method of representing music for performers and listeners. Besides its use in publishing sheet music, musical scores and parts, it has been encoded in different computer formats for over 30 years. The book Beyond MIDI describes over 20 of these published musical codes. There are also many more unpublished, proprietary codes. Given the high costs of traditional music publication, many companies have seen that Internet distribution has the potential to increase both the size and profitability of the sheet music market. To date, the Internet sheet music market has been hobbled by its reliance on a proliferation of proprietary binary formats. The most common format, Portable Document Format (PDF) , contains no musical semantics and can only be viewed on screen or printed on paper. Companies like Sunhawk, MusicNotes, Sibelius, and Noteheads all have different proprietary music formats for their sheet music players. If you buy sheet music from them or their partners today, you can play it, view it, or print it only with that single proprietary player. This provides little valueadded to consumers when compared to printed music on paper. We believe this has fragmented the online sheet music market and contributed significantly to its disappointing sales through 2001. Electronic musical instruments such as synthesizers faced a similar problem in the 1980s, when there was no way to get musical instruments from different vendors to work or play together. The invention of the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) format [MIDI 1996]solved this problem, and led to the rapid growth of the electronic musical instrument market. The introduction of General MIDI led to even further levels of compatibility, interchange, and growth in the instrument market. Today, MIDI remains the only symbolic music interchange format in wide use today. But MIDI, designed to solve problems in music performance, cannot represent much of what is found in sheet music. MP3 and other audio formats represent music recordings, not music notation.",

The goal of this project is to present an alternate method for visualizing music that makes use of color and 3D space. This paper describes one method of visualizing music in 3D space. The implementation of this method shows that music visualization is an effective technique, although it is certainly not the only possible method for accomplishing the task. Throughout the course of this project, several variations and alternative approaches were discussed. The final version of this project reflects the decisions that were made in order to present the best possible representation of music data.",

In the pilot experiment, visually similar melodies that had been rated as either good or bad were presented briefly, followed by a 15-sec retention interval and then recall. Musicians remembered good melodies better than they remembered bad ones: nonmusicians did not distinguish between them. In the second experiment, good, bad, and random melodies were briefly presented, followed by immediate recall. The advantage of musicians over nonmusicians decreased as the melody type progressed from good to bad to random. In the third experiment, musicians and nonmusicians divided the stimulus melodies into groups. For each melody, the consistency of grouping was correlated with memory performance in the first two experiments. Evidence was found for use of musical groupings by musicians and for use of a simple visual strategy by nonmusicians. The nature of these musical groupings and how they may be learned are considered. The relation of this work to other studies of comprehension of symbolic diagrams is also discussed.",

                  "abstract": "The interface of law and music has always appeared unnatural. While the law aims to provide certainty and order, music is more often observed as a field which operates in a boundary-less sphere. For that reason, the endeavor to treat purely musical issues with clear, conclusive and predetermined legal rules has been perceived as a fairly complicated task. Nevertheless, while music has become a prospering business, and musical disputes have been revolving around growing amounts of money, the law was required to step in and provide clear standards according to which these disputes should be settled. The courts in USA and UK have established and developed several doctrines intended to set a unified framework for assessing the extent of similarities between an original work and an allegedly later infringing work. The approach presented in the notable Arnstein decision has been reviewed and developed in multiple later cases but has remained relevant even after more than 70 years since its inception. This article explores all prominent approaches evolved to deal with musical plagiarism disputes during the last century, as well as some critical views and innovative ideas in this field. In addition, a novel method for evaluating substantial similarity is suggested, incorporating the overall impression test based on a lay listener comprehension with a statistical predictability analysis, aspiring to reach more accurate, reasonable andjust decisions. *Faculty of Law, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

                  "abstract": "In this Article, I focus on hip hop music and culture as an access point to teach first-year law students about the academic and professional pitfalls of plagiarism. Hip hop provides a good model for comparison because most of our entering students are immersed in a popular culture that is saturated with allusions to hip hop. As a point of reference for incoming law students, hip hop possesses a valuable currency as it represents something real, experienced, and relatable. Significant parallels exist between the cultures of U.S. legal writing and hip hop, although attempting direct analogies would be absurd. Chief among these similarities is the reliance of both cultures on an archive of knowledge, borrowing from which authors or artists build credibility and authority. Whether it is from case law or musical recordings, the necessary dependence on a finite store of information means that the past work of others will be frequently incorporated into new work. The ethical and professional danger inherent in this type of production is that one who borrows too freely from the past may be merely copying instead of interpreting or innovating. In the academic world, this is plagiarism. Members of the hip hop community call this biting. In neither culture is this mode of production celebrated. My goals for this project are two-fold. First, as a professor of legal writing, I want to ameliorate the problem of plagiarism that I have seen growing worse each year. Second, as a scholar, I would like to contribute to the growing body of literature on hip hop and the law. This Article marks the beginning of my attempt to theorize a hip hop ethics and develop its application to the teaching, the academic study, and perhaps eventually, the reform of the law.",

                  "abstract": "This paper, written for a conference of the Society for Economic Research on Copyright Issues, explores the history of copyright protection for musical compositions. The first modern copyright law did not cover musical works. The role of Johann Christian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Johann Neopmuk Hummel in securing legal changes is traced. How Giuseppe Verdi exploited the new copyright law in Northern Italy is analyzed. The paper argues that Verdi, enriched by copyright protection, reduced his compositional effort along a backward-bending supply curve. However, his good fortune may have had a demonstration effect inducing other talented individuals to become composers. An attempt to determine the impact of legal changes on entry into composing is inconclusive. The paper shows, however, that a golden age of musical composition nevertheless occurred in nations that lacked copyright protection for musical works.",

Subsequently, one member of the group can plagiarise another either by recalling that persons idea as their own (recall-own plagiarism), or by generating a novel solution that duplicates a previous idea (generate-new plagiarism). The current study examines the extent to which these forms of plagiarism are influenced by the quality of the ideas. Groups of participants initially generated ideas, prior to an elaboration phase in which idea quality was manipulated in two ways: participants received feedback on the quality of the ideas as rated by independent judges, and they generated improvements to a subset of the ideas. Unconscious plagiarism was measured in recall-own and generate-new tasks. For recall, idea improvement led to increased plagiarism, while for the generate-new task, the independent ratings influenced plagiarism. These data indicate that different source-judgement processes underlie the two forms of plagiarism, neither of which can be reduced simply to memory strength.",

Predictably Irrational is an intriguing, witty and utterly original look at why we all make illogical decisions. Why can a 50p aspirin do what a 5p aspirin cant? If an item is free it must be a bargain, right? Why is everything relative, even when it shouldnt be? How do our expectations influence our actual opinions and decisions? In this astounding book, behavioural economist Dan Ariely cuts to the heart of our strange behaviour, demonstrating how irrationality often supplants rational thought and that the reason for this is embedded in the very structure of our minds. Predicatably Irrational brilliantly blends everyday experiences with a series of illuminating and often surprising experiments, that will change your understanding of human behaviour. And, by recognising these patterns, Ariely shows that we can make better decisions in business, in matters of collective welfare, and in our everyday lives from drinking coffee to losing weight, buying a car to choosing a romantic partner.",

Contrary to Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine (2002), we show that Napster-type services are likely to reduce copyright value. This economic question of the effect of copying on copyright value largely coincides with the legal question of whether copying is fair use. The primary legal determinant of fair use (or use that does not require authorization by the copyright-holder) is whether the use adversely affects the present or future economic value of the copyrighted work. However, given this legal standard, it is unclear why copyright holders ever disagree with the court regarding fair use. Our analysis shows that there is no inherent conflict between the court and copyright holders with regard to particular uses, but why there may be a conflict with regard to a technology that has both fair and infringing uses.",

My approach assumes that demand by a typical consumer is positively related to quantities demanded by other consumers. This can explain not only the puzzle about prices but also why consumer demand is often fickle, why it is much easier to go from being in to being out than from out to in, and why supply does not increase to reduce the excess demand.",

                  "abstract": "Cryptomnesia, or inadvertent plagiarism, was experimentally examined in three investigations. Subjects were required to generate category exemplars, alternating with 3 other subjects in Experiments 1 and 2 or with a standardized, written list in Experiment 3. After this generation stage, subjects attempted to recall those items which they had just generated and an equal number of completely new items from each category. Plagiarism of others generated responses occurred in all three tasks (generation, recall own, and recall new) in each experiment, despite instructions to avoid such intrusions. The amount of plagiarism was greater under more complex generation sequences and for items produced from orthographic relative to semantic categories. The most likely source of plagiarized responses was the person who had responded just before the subject in the generation sequence. Directions for future research are discussed. The topic of plagiarism is of universal interest to scholar/ teachers because of occasional incidents encountered either with colleagues or students. Although intentional plagiarism is clearly an anathema to all professionals, there are situations where duplication occurs inadvertently. This uninlentional plagiarism, or cryptomnesia, is the focus of the present article. In the technical definition, cryptomnesia is .. .the presence of phenomena in normal consciousness which objectively are memories, but subjectively are not recognized as such. (Taylor, 1965, p. 1111). Cryptomnesia refers to generating a word, an idea, a song, or a solution to a problem, with the belief that it is either totally original, or at least original within the present context. In actuality, the item is not original, but one which has been produced by someone else (or even oneself) at some earlier time. A number of anecdotal discussions of cryptomnesia exist. Some of these recount public scandals where prominent individuals such as Nietzsche (Jung, 1905/1957) and Helen Keller (Bowers & Hilgard, 1986) have been accused of copying portions of other persons works. Freud (1901/1960) related that when he was developing his theory on original bisexuality, Fliess (a friend and professional colleague) reminded Freud that he had given Freud the idea several years earlier. At that time, Freud rejected his claim but later recalled the earlier incident.",

Conditions are given for when some, but not necessarily all, firms smuggle. With camouflaging, the market price is below the price when all sales are legal, so smuggling improves welfare if the price effect outweighs excess smuggling cost. This welfare effect is directly related to the degree of competition. Increased enforcement in this model potentially reduces welfare. The model is shown to be consistent with evidence on cigarette smuggling in the United States for 1975-1982.",

Even older content that was not born digital can relatively easily converted to machine-readable formats. At same time, the world has become more networked, making it easy to transfer digital content from one person to another. The combination of technological progress in both digitization and computer networking has been a challenge for traditional ways of managing intellectual property. Some observers have even questioned whether current models for intellectual property can or should survive in a digital world. For example, there is widespread concern about piracy of popular music and film, both via the network and via bootleg CDs and DVDs. There is also concern about the economic viability of the current model for scholarly publication, or, for that matter traditional forms of publishing such as newspapers and TV network news. These developments have led to a revival of interest in the economics of copying and copyright. In this brief review we examine some of the economic issues in this area, and describe some of the insights that have emerged from this work. We end with some reflections on alternative business models for provision of creative works.",

                  "abstract": "A growing interest in decision making in psychology is evidenced by the recent publication of Edwards review article in the Psychological Bulletin (1) and the Santa Monica Conference volume, Decision Processes (7). In this work, much attention has been focused on the characterization of rational choice, and because the latter topic has been a central concern in economics, the theory of decision making has become a natural meeting ground for psychological and economic theory. A comparative examination of the models of adaptive behavior employed in psychology (e.g., learning theories), and of the models of rational behavior employed in economics, shows that in almost all respects the latter postulate a much greater complexity in the choice mechanisms, and a much larger capacity in the organism for obtaining information and performing computations, than do the former. Moreover, in the limited range of situations where the predictions of the two theories have been compared (see [7, Ch. 9, 10, 18]), the learning theories appear to account for the observed behavior rather better than do the theories of rational behavior. Both from these scanty data and from an examination of the postulates of the economic models it appears probable that, however adaptive the behavior of organisms in learning and choice situations, this adaptiveness falls far short of the ideal of maximizing postulated in economic theory. Evidently, organisms adapt well enough to satisfice; they do not, in general, optimize. If this is the case, a great deal can be learned about rational decision making by taking into account, at the outset, the limitations upon the capacities and complexity of the organism, and by taking account of the fact that the environments to which it must adapt possess properties that permit further simplication of its choice mechanisms. It may be useful, therefore, to ask: How simple a set of choice mechanisms can we postulate and still obtain the gross features of observed adaptive choice behavior? In a previous paper (6) I have put forth some suggestions as to the kinds of approximate rationality that might be employed by an organism possessing limited information and limited computational facilities. The suggestions were hypothetical in that, lacking definitive knowledge of the human decisional processes, we can only conjecture on the basis of our everyday experiences, our introspection, and a very limited body of psychological literature what these",

                  "abstract": "Archaeological evidence for wind musical instruments made by modern humans has been well established from the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. Musical instruments evidently made by Neanderthals have not been found so far. The most controversial object is a juvenile cave bear femur with two complete holes, found in 1995 in the Middle Palaeolithic layers of the Cave Divje babe I, Slovenia. The bone was interpreted as a possible Neanderthal flute, but some scholars have firmly rejected this hypothesis on the basis of taphonomic observations, suggesting a carnivore origin for the holes. Here, we show the results of X-ray computed micro-tomography (mCT) performed on the Divje babe I flute. Our analyses demonstrate that there were originally four holes, possibly made with pointed stones and bone tools. Most surface modifications near the holes, previously interpreted as effects of carnivore gnawing, are post-depositional marks. Furthermore, a thin layer has been removed around one of the complete holes, producing a flat surface, possibly to facilitate perforation. The new data show that a Neanderthal manufacture of the object cannot be ruled out.",

Musicians and musicologists use transcription to better understand music that may not have a written form, from improvised jazz solos to traditional folk music. Automatic music transcription introduces signal-processing algorithms to extract pitch and rhythm information from recordings. This speeds up and automates the process of music transcription, which requires musical training and is very time consuming even for experts. This thesis explores the still unsolved problem of automatic music transcription through an in-depth analysis of the problem itself and an overview of different techniques to solve the hardest subtask of music transcription, multiple pitch estimation. It concludes with a close study of a typical multiple pitch estimation algorithm and highlights the challenges that remain unsolved.",

In order to build the compound model, we trained three different models: prediction by partial matching, a hidden Markov model and a deep recurrent neural network on a novel large dataset containing half a million annotated chord sequences. We describe the training process and propose an interpretation of the harmonic patterns that are learned by the hidden states of these models. We use the compound model to generate new chord sequences and estimate their probability, which we then relate to perceived harmonic complexity. In order to collect subjective ratings of complexity, we devised a listening test comprising two different experiments. In the first, subjects choose the more complex chord sequence between two. In the second, subjects rate with a continuous scale the complexity of a single chord sequence. The results of both experiments show a strong relation between negative log probability, given by our language model, and the perceived complexity ratings. The relation is stronger for subjects with high musical sophistication index, acquired through the GoldMSI standard questionnaire. The analysis of the results also includes the preference ratings that have been collected along with the complexity ratings; a weak negative correlation emerged between preference and log probability.",

Streamingdienste, Downloadportale und private Archive stellen umfangreiche Kollektionen von Musikaufnahmen zur Verfugung. Im Forschungsbereich Music Information Retrieval werden Algorithmen zur Strukturierung und Durchsuchung solcher Archive entwickelt. Eine typische Anwendung ist die Klassifizierung von Aufnahmen hinsichtlich musikalischer Genres. Diese Arbeit befasst sich mit solchen Klassifikationsproblemen mit dem Ziel einer Differenzierung innerhalb der abendlandischen Kunstmusik. Dabei stehen stilistische Kategorien wie Epochen der Musikgeschichte oder Komponisten im Fokus. Musikwissenschaftler fuhren solche Stilanalysen typischerweise auf Basis von Partituren durch. Ein wesentlicher Beitrag dieser Arbeit ist die Entwicklung computergestutzter Methoden zur Analyse umfangreicher Korpora von Audiodaten. Die Experimente konzentrieren sich dabei auf die Parameter Harmonik und Tonalitat. Als erster Schritt werden die Audiodaten mittels Signalverarbeitungstechniken in Chromadarstellungen uberfuhrt. Auf dieser Basis werden musiktheoretische Konzepte modelliert und das Auftreten tonaler Strukturen gemessen. Einer der vorgestellten Algorithmen ermittelt die Grundtonart eines Stuckes unter Berucksichtigung des Schlussakkords. Eine weitere Methode dient zur Visualisierung von Modulationsstrukturen hinsichtlich diatonischer Skalen sowie von lokal vorherrschenden Skalentypen. Weiterhin werden Methoden zur Messung von Intervall- und Akkordtypen sowie zur Quantifizierung tonaler Komplexitat eingefuhrt. Auf Basis dieser Audiomerkmale werden stilistische Analysen von Musikaufnahmen realisiert. Mit Hilfe unuberwachter Lernmethoden wird die stilistische Ahnlichkeit von Musikstucken im Bezug auf Komponisten und Kompositionsjahre veranschaulicht. Weiterhin werden Experimente zur Klassifizierung nach Epoche oder Komponist durchgefuhrt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die tonalen Merkmale stilrelevante Eigenschaften auf stabile Weise modellieren. Im Gegensatz dazu fuhrt die Verwendung von Standardmerkmalen haufig zu einer Uberanpassung der Modelle, was sich negativ auf die Klassifikationsergebnisse auswirkt. Dies zeigt, dass sich tonale Eigenschaften zur Stilunterscheidung heranziehen lassen und dass solche Eigenschaften direkt aus Audioaufnahmen gemessen werden konnen.",

The features rely on statistical measures based on a chroma feature representation of the audio data and describe the tonal complexity of the music, independently from the orchestration or timbre of the music. To analyze this property, we use a dataset containing piano and orchestral music from four general historical periods including Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern. By applying dimensionality reduction techniques, we derive visualizations that demonstrate the discriminative power of the features with regard to the music styles. In classification experiments, we evaluate the features performance using an SVM classifier. We investigate the influence of artist filtering with respect to the individual composers on the classification performance. In all experiments, we compare the results to the performance of standard features. We show that the introduced features capture meaningful properties of musical style and are robust to timbral variations.",

While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature. To rectify this, we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using music information retrieval and text-mining tools, we analyse the musical properties of approximately 17000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic revolutions around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by discussing how our study points the way to a quantitative science of cultural change.",

This is the first comprehensive study of his music, examining not only the famous keyboard sonatas and concertos but also the songs, the chamber music, and the sacred works, many of which resurfaced only recently and have not previously been evaluated. A compositional biography, the book surveys C. P. E. Bachs extensive output of nearly a thousand works while tracing his musical development-from his student days at Leipzig and Frankfurt (Oder), through his nearly three decades as court musician to Prussian King Frederick the Great, to his final twenty years as cantor and music director at Hamburg. David Schulenberg, author of important books on the music of J. S. Bach and his first son, W. F. Bach, here considers the legacy of the second son from a compelling new perspective. Focusing on C. P. E. Bachs compositional choices within his social and historical context, Schulenberg shows how C. P. E. Bach deliberately avoided his fathers style while borrowing from the manner of his Berlin colleagues, who were themselves inspired by Italian opera. Schulenberg also shows how C. P. E. Bach, now best known for his virtuoso keyboard works, responded to changing cultural and aesthetic trends by refashioning himself as a writer of vocal music and popular chamber compositions. Audio versions of the books musical examples, as well as further examples and supplementary tables and texts, are available on a companion website. David Schulenberg is professor of music at Wagner College and teaches historical performance at the Juilliard School. He is the author of The Music of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (University of Rochester Press, 2010).",

Understanding the interaction between these basic components is very important not only for achieving optimal performance, but also for assessing the potential and limitations of the system. Unfortunately, there are no studies that sufficiently evaluate the effects of the different approaches to each processing step and the interactions between these steps. In this paper we attempt to remedy this deficiency by performing a systematic evaluation encompassing a wide variety of techniques used for each processing step. In our study we find that filtering has a significant impact on performance, but providing musical context information in the transition matrix is rendered moot by the need to enforce continuity in the estimations. We discovered that the benefits of using complex chord models can be largely offset by an appropriate choice of features. In addition, the initial performance gap between different features were not fully compensated by any subsequent processing stages.",

These statistics, called expectancies, are found in music perception, and they span a variety of different features and time scales. Specifically, there is evidence that music perception involves strong expectancies regarding the distribution of a melodic interval, namely, the distance between two consecutive notes within the context of another. The recent availability of a large Western music dataset, consisting of the historical record condensed as melodic interval counts, has opened new possibilities for data-driven analysis of musical perception. In this context, we present an analytical approach that, based on cognitive theories of music expectation and machine learning techniques, recovers a set of factors that accurately identifies historical trends and stylistic transitions between the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Post-Romantic periods. We also offer a plausible musicological and cognitive interpretation of these factors, allowing us to propose them as data-driven principles of melodic expectation.",

A contribution of our work is that we address the problem of finding an analysis window length for local key estimation that is adapted to the intrinsic music content of the analyzed piece by introducing information related to the metrical structure in our model. Key estimation is not performed on empirically chosen segments but on segments that are expressed in relationship with the tempo period. We evaluate and analyze our results on two databases of different styles. We systematically analyze the influence of various parameters to determine factors important to our model, we study the relationships between the various musical attributes that are taken into account in our work, and we provide case study examples.",

When multiple systems appear on a page, they are arranged from the top to the bottom of the page, similar to lines of words in a text document. Encoding music notation documents for printing requires this arrangement to be captured. However, in the music notation model proposed by the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), the hierarchy of the XML sub-tree representing the music emphasizes the content rather than the layout. Since systems and pages do not coincide with the musical content, they are encoded in a secondary hierarchy that contains very limited information. In this paper, we present a complementary solution for augmenting the level of detail of the layout of musical documents; that is, the layout information can be encoded in a separate sub-tree with cross-references to other elements holding the musical content. The major advantage of the proposed solution is that it enables multiple layout descriptions, each describing a different visual instantiation of the same musical content.",

In pop and jazz music, a sequence of chord labels is often the only written record of a song, and forms the basis of so-called lead sheets. We devise a fully automatic method to simultaneously estimate from an audio waveform the chord sequence including bass notes, the metric positions of chords, and the key. The core of the method is a six-layered dynamic Bayesian network, in which the four hidden source layers jointly model metric position, key, chord, and bass pitch class, while the two observed layers model low-level audio features corresponding to bass and treble tonal content. Using 109 different chords our method provides substantially more harmonic detail than previous approaches while maintaining a high level of accuracy. We show that with 71% correctly classified chords our method significantly exceeds the state of the art when tested against manually annotated ground truth transcriptions on the 176 audio tracks from the MIREX 2008 Chord Detection Task. We introduce a measure of segmentation quality and show that bass and meter modeling are especially beneficial for obtaining the correct level of granularity.",

By identifying spectral components that differ by a musical octave, chroma features possess a considerable amount of robustness to changes in timbre and instrumentation. In this paper, we describe a novel procedure that further enhances chroma features by significantly boosting the degree of timbre invariance without degrading the features discriminative power. Our idea is based on the generally accepted observation that the lower mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are closely related to timbre. Now, instead of keeping the lower coefficients, we discard them and only keep the upper coefficients. Furthermore, using a pitch scale instead of a mel scale allows us to project the remaining coefficients onto the 12 chroma bins. We present a series of experiments to demonstrate that the resulting chroma features outperform various state-of-the art features in the context of music matching and retrieval applications. As a final contribution, we give a detailed analysis of our enhancement procedure revealing the musical meaning of certain pitch-frequency cepstral coefficients.",

The choice of chord profiles and higher-level time-series modelling have received a lot of attention, resulting in methods with an overall performance of more than 70% in the MIREX Chord Detection task 2009. Research on the front end of chord transcription algorithms has often concentrated on finding good chord templates to fit the chroma features. In this paper we reverse this approach and seek to find chroma features that are more suitable for usage in a musically-motivated model. We do so by performing a prior approximate transcription using an existing technique to solve non-negative least squares problems (NNLS). The resulting NNLS chroma features are tested by using them as an input to an existing state-of-the-art high-level model for chord transcription. We achieve very good results of 80% accuracy using the song collection and metric of the 2009 MIREX Chord Detection tasks. This is a significant increase over the top result (74%) in MIREX 2009. The nature of some chords makes their identification particularly susceptible to confusion between fundamental frequency and partials. We show that the recognition of these diffcult",

Specifically, a Diffusion Maps (DM) framework is used and its parameter tuning is discussed.

To compare two recordings, we simply cross-correlate the entire beat-by-chroma representation for two tracks and look for sharp peaks indicating good local alignment between the pieces.

Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sorensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the MorisitaHorn index as special cases.",

The three trained key profiles differ in their temporal weighting of information across the duration of the song. One profile is based on uniform weighting while the other two apply emphasis on the beginning and ending of the song, respectively. The actual key extraction is based on comparing the key profiles with three average chromagrams that were extracted from a particular piece of music using the same temporal weighting functions as used for the key profile training.

Given a short query audio clip, an important task in audio retrieval is to automatically and efficiently identify all corresponding audio clips irrespective of the specific interpretation or instrumentation. In view of this problem, which is also referred to as audio matching, the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new type of audio feature that strongly correlates to the harmonic progression of the audio signal. In addition, our feature shows a high degree of robustness to variations in parameters such as dynamics, timbre, articulation, and local tempo deviations. The feature design is carried out in two stages basically taking short-time statistics over chroma-based energy distributions. Here, the chroma correspond to the 12 traditional pitch classes of the equal-tempered scale. Applied to audio matching on a large audio database consisting of a wide range of classical music (112 hours of audio material), our features proved to be a powerful tool providing accurate matchings in an efficient way concerning time as well as memory requirements.",

However, these methods are necessarily media dependent. We present a system for producing short, representative samples (or audio thumbnails) of selections of popular music. The system searches for structural redundancy within a given song with the aim of identifying something like a chorus or refrain. To isolate a useful class of features for performing such structure-based pattern recognition, we present a development of the chromagram, a variation on traditional time-frequency distributions that seeks to represent the cyclic attribute of pitch perception, known as chroma. The pattern recognition system itself employs a quantized chromagram that represents the spectral energy at each of the 12 pitch classes. We evaluate the system on a database of popular music and score its performance against a set of ideal thumbnail locations. Overall performance is found to be quite good, with the majority of errors resulting from songs that do not meet our structural assumptions.",

Many recent scholars have privileged institutional and reception history over style and compositional history, and periodized European music according to the centuries; but these constructions are no less partial or tendentious than older ones. Recent historiographical writings addressing these issues are evaluated. If we wish to construe the eighteenth century as a music-historical period, we must abandon the traditional notion that it was bifurcated in the middle. Not only did the musical Baroque not last beyond 1720 in most areas, but the years c1720c1780 constituted a period in their own right, dominated by the international system of Italian opera, Enlightenment ideals, neoclassicism, the galant and (after c1760) the cult of sensibility. We may call this the central eighteenth century. Furthermore, this period can be clearly distinguished from preceding and following ones. The late Baroque (c1670c1720) was marked by the rationalization of Italian opera, tragdie lyrique, the standardization of instrumental genres and the rise of strong tonality. The period c1780c1830 witnessed the rise of the regulative work-concept (Goehr) and pre-Romanticism (Dahlhaus), and the Europe-wide triumph of Viennese modernism, including the first autonomous instrumental music and a central role in the rise of the modern (post-revolutionary) world, symbolized by Haydns sublime in The Creation. A tripartite reading of a long eighteenth-century in music history along these lines seems more nearly adequate than either baroque/classical or 17001800 as a single, undifferentiated period.",

Chord sequences are a description that captures much of the character of a piece in a compact form and using a modest lexicon. Chords also have the attractive property that a piece of music can (mostly) be segmented into time intervals that consist of a single chord, much as recorded speech can (mostly) be segmented into time intervals that correspond to specific words. In this work, we build a system for automatic chord transcription using speech recognition tools. For features we use pitch class profile vectors to emphasize the tonal content of the signal, and we show that these features far outperform cepstral coefficients for our task. Sequence recognition is accomplished with hidden Markov models (HMMs) directly analogous to subword models in a speech recognizer, and trained by the same Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Crucially, this allows us to use as input only the chord sequences for our training examples, without requiring the precise timings of the chord changes  which are determined automatically during training. Our results on a small set of 20 early Beatles songs show frame-level accuracy of around 75% on a forced-alignment task.",

The present work is the first to set forth a general theoretical framework for the systematic description of the processes underlying this music. The author describes the elemental transformations and relations that provide the basis for cohesive and coherent musical structure. He first presents the basic ideas (pitch-class sets and relations) and the connections between them and then brings these concepts within the scope of a general model of structure (the pitch-class set complex). Throughout, the significance and musical relevance of the theoretical constructs are documented by many excerpts from the large repertory of atonal music.",

                  "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning an N-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. The process, which is called k-means, appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say tends to be low, primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea. The extension to general metric spaces is indicated briefly in section 4. The original point of departure for the work described here was a series of problems in optimal classification (MacQueen [9]) which represented special",

Recently, the growing field of music information retrieval (MIR) has offered quantitative analyses to complement traditional qualitative analyses of these composers. In this MIR study, we classify the composer of Haydn and Mozart string quartets based on the content of their scores. Our contribution is an interpretable statistical and machine learning approach that provides high classification accuracies and musical relevance. We develop novel global features that are automatically computed from symbolic data and informed by musicological HaydnMozart comparative studies, particularly relating to the sonata form. Several of these proposed features are found to be important for distinguishing between Haydn and Mozart string quartets. Our Bayesian logistic regression model attains leave-one-out classification accuracies over 84%, higher than prior works and providing interpretations that could aid in assessing musicological claims. Overall, our work can help expand the longstanding dialogue surrounding Haydn and Mozart and exemplify the benefit of interpretable machine learning in MIR, with potential applications to music generation and classification of other classical composers.",

Furthermore, we show this convergence is very slow, and only logarithmic in the convergence of the loss itself. This can help explain the benefit of continuing to optimize the logistic or cross-entropy loss even after the training error is zero and the training loss is extremely small, and, as we show, even if the validation loss increases.

An excerpt of a piece to be classied is rst sampled to a 2D pitchtime representation which is then subjected to various transformations, including convolution with predened lters (Morlet or Gaussian) and classied by means of support vector machines. We combine classiers based on different pitch representations (MIDI and morphetic pitch) and different lter types and congurations. The method does not require parsing of the music into separate voices, or extraction of any other predened features prior to processing; instead it is based on the analysis of texture in a 2D pitchtime representation. We show that ltering signicantly improves recognition and that the method proves robust to encoding, transposition and amount of information. On discriminating between Haydn and Mozart string quartet movements, our best classier reaches state-of-the-art performance in leave-one-out cross validation.",

On the other hand, determining compositional authorship through internal factorsthrough stylistic traits of composers derived from the music itselfis often fraught with errors and biases. One of the underlying assumptions in the field of stylometry is that, while it is difficult for humans to perform a truly unbiased analysis of authorial attribution, computational methods can provide clearer and more objective guidelines than would otherwise be apparent to readers or listeners, and thus might provide corroboration or clues for further investigation. This paper discusses machine-learning approaches for evaluating attribution for compositions by Josquin des Prez. We explore musical characteristics such as melodic sequences, counterpoint motion, rhythmic variability, and other entry measures to search for features inherent to a composers works or style, and we hope that employing such an approachone that explicitly states which factors led to the decision-making processcan serve to inform scholars looking at other works and composers.",

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

Our work expands on previous style classification studies by developing more complex features as well as introducing a new class of musical features which focus on local irregularities within musical scores. We demonstrate the discriminative power of the system as applied to Haydn and Mozarts string quartets.

                  "abstract": "Musical style recognition is somehow intrinsic to human nature: the average layperson can tell the difference between a motet by Josquin and a symphony by Beethoven. But things change when it comes to computers. Musical style and its transformations take place in ways musicology is still unable perfectly to define. Up to now, computer-aided research on style has greatly privileged the rule-based approach (Baroni Dalmonte and Jacoboni, Lerdahl and Jackendoff, Ebcioglu, etc.). In this paper we use a supervised learning approach to create a style recognizer which is able to expose genre-attributable differences both within Palestrinas music (how is a mass different from a motet or a madrigal) and between Palestrina and other composers (either contemporary or younger/older). Our recognizer is implemented using a back-propagation neural network, with a number of innovative techniques to account for the special nature of musical input. Our technique makes no assumptions about the period or style of music being studied, but our experiments have focused on Palestrina. Results are promising: our technique seems to possess those generalization capabilities which are essential when dealing with a matter of such proteiform complexity as musical style.",

We employed a data set of 605 musical themes written by five well-known composers (Mozart, Beethoven, Dvorak, Stravinsky, Beatles). A preliminary investigation based on descriptive statistics served the purpose of choosing a group of suitable music representations. Then, for each representation and for each composer a HMM was trained with the subset of melodic lines extracted from the pieces. An unknown melody is then classified as belonging to a composer if the corresponding HMM gives the highest probability for that sequence. Experiments with Markov chains and tests on human subjects were used as a term of comparison. The best results achieved with HMMs was 42% successful classifications on average, obtained with an alphabet of intervals between -10 and +10 semitones and with HMMs of order 18. In the case of human classification based only on stylistic assumption, we measured 24.6% for music amateurs and 48% for music experts. In conclusion, HMMs performed nearly as well as a music expert in the classification of melodies by composer, nevertheless, memory models have been proven to play a fundamental role in the process of music classification and need to be taken into consideration for practical applications.",

Given a playlist of arbitrary length with some additional meta-data, the task was to recommend up to 500 tracks that fit the target characteristics of the original playlist. For the RecSys Challenge, Spotify released a dataset of one million user-generated playlists. Participants could compete in two tracks, i.e., main and creative tracks. Participants in the main track were only allowed to use the provided training set, however, in the creative track, the use of external public sources was permitted. In total, 113 teams submitted 1,228 runs to the main track; 33 teams submitted 239 runs to the creative track. The highest performing team in the main track achieved an R-precision of 0.2241, an NDCG of 0.3946, and an average number of recommended songs clicks of 1.784. In the creative track, an R-precision of 0.2233, an NDCG of 0.3939, and a click rate of 1.785 was obtained by the best team. This article provides an overview of the challenge, including motivation, task definition, dataset description, and evaluation. We further report and analyze the results obtained by the top-performing teams in each track and explore the approaches taken by the winners. We finally summarize our key findings, discuss generalizability of approaches and results to domains other than music, and list the open avenues and possible future directions in the area of automatic playlist continuation.",

Stress and driving are a dangerous combination and can lead to life-threatening situations, evidenced by the large number of road traffic crashes that occur every year due to driver stress. In addition, the rate of general health issues caused by work-related chronic stress in drivers who work in public and private transport is greater than in many other occupational groups. An in-vehicle warning system for driver stress levels is needed to continuously predict dangerous driving situations and proactively alert drivers to ensure safe and comfortable driving. As a result of the recent developments in ambient intelligence, such as sensing technologies, pervasive devices, context recognition, and communications, driver stress can be automatically detected using multimodal measurements. This critical review investigates the state of the art of techniques and achievements for automatic driver stress level detection based on multimodal sensors and data. In this work, the most widely used data followed by frequent and highly performed selected features to detect driver stress levels are analyzed and presented. This review also discusses key methodological issues and gaps that hinder the implementation of driver stress detection systems and offers insights into future research directions.",

We propose to learn a decision tree, which clarifies the specific reason for each prediction made by the CNN at the semantic level. I.e., the decision tree decomposes feature representations in high conv-layers of the CNN into elementary concepts of object parts. In this way, the decision tree tells people which object parts activate which filters for the prediction and how much each object part contributes to the prediction score. Such semantic and quantitative explanations for CNN predictions have specific values beyond the traditional pixel-level analysis of CNNs. More specifically, our method mines all potential decision modes of the CNN, where each mode represents a typical case of how the CNN uses object parts for prediction. The decision tree organizes all potential decision modes in a coarse-to-fine manner to explain CNN predictions at different fine-grained levels. Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Finding an effective method to use these data in recommending appropriate music to users during a short-term session is a significant challenge. Another serious problem is that most of the data, in reality, obey the long-tailed distribution, which consequently leads to traditional music recommendation systems recommending a lot of popular music that users do not like on a specific occasion. To solve these problems, we propose a heterogeneous knowledge-based attentive neural network model for short-term music recommendations. First, we collect three types of data for modeling entities in usermusic interaction network, i.e., graphic, textual, and visual data, and then embed them into high-dimensional spaces using the TransR, distributed memory version of paragraph vector, and variational autoencoder methods, respectively. The concatenation of these embedding results is an abstract representation of the entity. Based on this, a recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism is built, which is capable of obtaining users preferences in the current session and consequently making recommendations. The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art short-term music recommendation systems on one real-world dataset. In addition, it can also recommend more relatively unpopular songs compared with classic models.",

For the Challenge, Spotify released a dataset of one million user-created playlists, along with associated metadata. Participants could submit their approaches in two tracks, i.e., main and creative tracks, where the former allowed teams to use solely the provided dataset and the latter allowed them to exploit publicly available external data too. In total, 113 teams submitted 1,228 runs in the main track; 33 teams submitted 239 runs in the creative track. The highest performing team in the main track achieved an R-precision of 0.2241, an NDCG of 0.3946, and an average number of recommended songs clicks of 1.784. In the creative track, an R-precision of 0.2233, an NDCG of 0.3939, and a click rate of 1.785 was realized by the best team.",

Often the aim of these systems is to increase the time, the user spends on the platform and hence having a high commercial value. The systems which aim at increasing the average time a user spends on the platform often need to recommend songs which the user might want to listen to next at each point in time. This is different from recommendation systems which try to predict the item which might be of interest to the user at some point in the user lifetime but not necessarily in the very near future. Prediction of next song the user might like requires some kind of modeling of the user interests at the given point of time. Attentive neural networks have been exploiting the sequence in which the items were selected by the user to model the implicit short-term interests of the user for the task of next item prediction, however we feel that features of the songs occurring in the sequence could also convey some important information about the short-term user interest which only the items cannot. In this direction we propose a novel attentive neural architecture which in addition to the sequence of items selected by the user, uses the features of these items to better learn the user short-term preferences and recommend next song to the user.",

In order to predict the next song in a playlist, some of the playlist models proposed so far consider the current and previous songs in the playlist (i.e., the song context) and possibly the order of the songs in the playlist. We investigate the impact of the song context and the song order on next-song recommendations by conducting dedicated off-line experiments on two datasets of hand-curated music playlists. Firstly, we compare three playlist models, each able to consider a different song context length: a popularity-based model, a song-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) model and a Recurrent-Neural-Network-based model (RNN). We also consider a model that predicts next songs at random as a reference. Secondly, we challenge the RNN model (the only model from the first experiment able to consider the song order) by manipulating the order of songs within playlists. Our results indicate that the song context has a positive impact on the quality of next-song recommendations, even though this effect can be masked by the bias towards very popular songs. Furthermore, in our experiments the song order does not appear as a crucial variable to predict better next-song recommendations.",

We start this paper by formulating score following as a multimodal Markov Decision Process, the mathematical foundation for sequential decision making. Given this formal definition, we address the score following task with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as synchronous advantage actor critic (A2C). In particular, we design multimodal RL agents that simultaneously learn to listen to music, read the scores from images of sheet music, and follow the audio along in the sheet, in an end-to-end fashion. All this behavior is learned entirely from scratch, based on a weak and potentially delayed reward signal that indicates to the agent how close it is to the correct position in the score. Besides discussing the theoretical advantages of this learning paradigm, we show in experiments that it is in fact superior compared to previously proposed methods for score following in raw sheet music images.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate how real-time music score alignment can serve as a tool for a computer-assisted page turner. We proposed a simple system which can be set up easily and quickly for use to solve the problem. The framework of the system has two parts: off-line preprocessing stage and online alignment stage. In the first stage, the system extracts chroma feature vectors from the reference recording. In the second stage, the system receives audio signals of live performance and extracts chroma feature vectors from them. Finally, the system uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to find an alignment between those two sets of chroma feature vectors to mark the current measure of the score. The prototype system was evaluated by musicians in different music ensembles like string quartet and orchestra. Most musicians agreed that the system is helpful and can indicate the current measure of a live performance correctly. Some musicians, however, disagreed that the system turned the page at right time. The user survey showed that the best timing for page turning is user-dependent because it is highly to do with musicians sight reading skills and speed.",

Academic research in the field is historically often based on the matrix completion problem formulation, where for each user-item-pair only one interaction (e.g., a rating) is considered. In many application domains, however, multiple user-item interactions of different types can be recorded over time. And, a number of recent works have shown that this information can be used to build richer individual user models and to discover additional behavioral patterns that can be leveraged in the recommendation process. In this work, we review existing works that consider information from such sequentially ordered user-item interaction logs in the recommendation process. Based on this review, we propose a categorization of the corresponding recommendation tasks and goals, summarize existing algorithmic solutions, discuss methodological approaches when benchmarking what we call sequence-aware recommender systems, and outline open challenges in the area.",

Although these categories are not mutually exclusive, most related research is traditionally focused on classifying tracks into a single class. Furthermore, these categories (e.g., Pop, Rock) tend to be too broad for certain applications. In this work we aim to expand this task by categorizing musical items into multiple and fine-grained labels, using three different data modalities: audio, text, and images. To this end we present MuMu, a new dataset of more than 31k albums classified into 250 genre classes. For every album we have collected the cover image, text reviews, and audio tracks. Additionally, we propose an approach for multi-label genre classification based on the combination of feature embeddings learned with state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies. Experiments show major differences between modalities, which not only introduce new baselines for multi-label genre classification, but also suggest that combining them yields improved results.",

Music streaming services often ingest all available music, but this poses a challenge: how to recommend new artists for which prior knowledge is scarce? In this work we aim to address this so-called cold-start problem by combining text and audio information with user feedback data using deep network architectures. Our method is divided into three steps. First, artist embeddings are learned from biographies by combining semantics, text features, and aggregated usage data. Second, track embeddings are learned from the audio signal and available feedback data. Finally, artist and track embeddings are combined in a multimodal network. Results suggest that both splitting the recommendation problem between feature levels (i.e., artist metadata and audio track), and merging feature embeddings in a multimodal approach improve the accuracy of the recommendations.",

In contrast to other books dealing solely with music signal processing, it addresses additional cultural and listener-centric aspects and thus provides a more holistic view. Consequently, the text includes methods operating on features extracted directly from the audio signal, as well as methods operating on features extracted from contextual information, either the cultural context of music as represented on the web or the user and usage context of music. Following the prevalent document-centered paradigm of information retrieval, the book addresses models of music similarity that extract computational features to describe an entity that represents music on any level (e.g., song, album, or artist), and methods to calculate the similarity between them. While this perspective and the representations discussed cannot describe all musical dimensions, they enable us to effectively find music of similar qualities by providing abstract summarizations of musical artifacts from different modalities. The text at hand provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the topics of music search, retrieval, and recommendation from an academic perspective. It will not only allow those new to the field to quickly access MIR from an information retrieval point of view but also raise awareness for the developments of the music domain within the greater IR community. In this regard, Part I deals with content-based MIR, in particular the extraction of features from the music signal and similarity calculation for content-based retrieval. Part II subsequently addresses MIR methods that make use of the digitally accessible cultural context of music. Part III addresses methods of collaborative filtering and user-aware and multi-modal retrieval, while Part IV explores current and future applications of music retrieval and recommendation.",

Real-life recommender systems often face the problem of having to base recommendations only on short session-based data (e.g. a small sportsware website) instead of long user histories (as in the case of Netflix). In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations, i.e. recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session, more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations. Our approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to classic RNNs such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem. Experimental results on two data-sets show marked improvements over widely used approaches.",

Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH. ",

Meanwhile, collaborative filtering has the well-known cold-start problem, i.e., it is unable to work with new songs that no one has listened to. Efforts on incorporating content information into collaborative filtering methods have shown success in many non-musical applications, such as scientific article recommendation. Inspired by the related work, we train a neural network on semantic tagging information as a content model and use it as a prior in a collaborative filtering model. Such a system still allows the user listening data to speak for itself. The proposed system is evaluated on the Million Song Dataset and shows comparably better result than the collaborative filtering approaches, in addition to the favorable performance in the cold-start case.",

                  "abstract": "Most of the time when we listen to music on the radio or on our portable devices, the order in which the tracks are played is governed by so-called playlists. These playlists are basically sequences of tracks that traditionally are designed manually and whose organization is based on some underlying logic or theme. With the digitalization of music and the availability of various types of additional track-related information on the Web, new opportunities have emerged on how to automate the playlist creation process. Correspondingly, a number of proposals for automated playlist generation have been made in the literature during the past decade. These approaches vary both with respect to which kind of data they rely on and which types of algorithms they use. In this article, we review the literature on automated playlist generation and categorize the existing approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation designs that are used today in research to assess the quality of the generated playlists. Finally, we report the results of a comparative evaluation of typical playlist generation schemes based on historical data. Our results show that track and artist popularity can play a dominant role and that additional measures are required to better characterize and compare the quality of automatically generated playlists.",

They first extract traditional audio content features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and then predict user preferences. However, these traditional features, originally not created for music recommendation, cannot capture all relevant information in the audio and thus put a cap on recommendation performance. Using a novel model based on deep belief network and probabilistic graphical model, we unify the two stages into an automated process that simultaneously learns features from audio content and makes personalized recommendations. Compared with existing deep learning based models, our model outperforms them in both the warm-start and cold-start stages without relying on collaborative filtering (CF). We then present an efficient hybrid method to seamlessly integrate the automatically learnt features and CF. Our hybrid method not only significantly improves the performance of CF but also outperforms the traditional feature mbased hybrid method.",

When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, powerful, strong and Paris are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.",

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

Most recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering. However, this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep convolutional neural networks significantly outperforming the traditional approach.",

In this paper, we present Latent Markov Embedding (LME), a machine learning algorithm for generating such playlists. In analogy to matrix factorization methods for collaborative filtering, the algorithm does not require songs to be described by features a priori, but it learns a representation from example playlists. We formulate this problem as a regularized maximum-likelihood embedding of Markov chains in Euclidian space, and show how the resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently. An empirical evaluation shows that the LME is substantially more accurate than adaptations of smoothed n-gram models commonly used in natural language processing.",

As almost every music piece is created to convey emotion, music organization and retrieval by emotion is a reasonable way of accessing music information. A good deal of effort has been made in the music information retrieval community to train a machine to automatically recognize the emotion of a music signal. A central issue of machine recognition of music emotion is the conceptualization of emotion and the associated emotion taxonomy. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of different ways of emotion annotation, model training, and result visualization. This article provides a comprehensive review of the methods that have been proposed for music emotion recognition. Moreover, as music emotion recognition is still in its infancy, there are many open issues. We review the solutions that have been proposed to address these issues and conclude with suggestions for further research.",

This study explores the potential use of AMS results for generating playlists based on similarity. We asked participants to listen to a subset of results from the 2010 AMS task and evaluate the set of candidates generated by the algorithms as a playlist generated from a seed song (the query). We found that while similarity does affect how people feel about the candidate set as a playlist, other factors such as variety, metadata, personal preference, familiarity, mix of familiar and new music, etc. also strongly affect users perceptions of playlist quality as well.

Some recent studies pose MER as a continuous regression problem in the Arousal-Valence (AV) plane. These consist of variations on a common architecture having a universal model of emotional response, a common repertoire of low-level audio features, a bag-of-frames approach to audio analysis, and relatively small data sets. These approaches achieve some success at MER and suggest that further improvements are possible with current technology. Our contribution to the state of the art is to examine just how far one can go within this framework, and to investigate what the limitations of this framework are. We present the results of a systematic study conducted in an attempt to maximize the prediction performance of an automated MER system using the architecture described. We begin with a carefully constructed data set, emphasizing quality over quantity. We address affect induction rather than affect attribution. We consider a variety of algorithms at each stage of the training process, from preprocessing to feature selection and model selection, and we report the results of extensive testing. We found that: (1) none of the variations we considered leads to a substantial improvement in performance, which we present as evidence of a limit on what is achievable under this architecture, and (2) the size of the small data sets that are commonly used in the MER literature limits the possibility of improving the set of features used in MER due to the phenomenon of Subset Selection Bias. We conclude with some proposals for advancing the state of the art.",

These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods.

We further extend the PMF model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the model capacity can be controlled automatically. Finally, we introduce a constrained version of the PMF model that is based on the assumption that users who have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with very few ratings. When the predictions of multiple PMF models are linearly combined with the predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate of 0.8861, that is nearly 7% better than the score of Netflixs own system.",

There are many approaches and techniques introduced every year to address a wide range of challenges and analysis tasks, enabling researchers from different disciplines to obtain leading-edge knowledge from digitized collections of text. This can be challenging particularly when the data is massive. Additionally, the sources of digital text have spread substantially in the last decades in various forms, such as web pages, blogs, twitter, email, electronic publications, and digitized books. In response to the explosion of text visualization research literature, the first text visualization survey article was published in 2010. Furthermore, there are a growing number of surveys that review existing techniques and classify them based on text research methodology. In this work, we aim to present the first Survey of Surveys (SoS) that review all of the surveys and state-of-the-art papers on text visualization techniques and provide an SoS classification. We study and compare the 14 surveys, and categorize them into five groups: (1) Document-centered, (2) user task analysis, (3) cross-disciplinary, (4) multi-faceted, and (5) satellite-themed. We provide survey recommendations for researchers in the field of text visualization. The result is a very unique, valuable starting point and overview of the current state-of-the-art in text visualization research literature.",

                  "abstract": "Background: Interdisciplinary work is needed for scientific progress, and with this review, our interest is in the scientific progress toward understanding the underlying mechanisms of auditory-motor coupling, and how this can be applied to gait rehabilitation. Specifically we look into the process of entrainment and synchronization; where entrainment is the process that governs the dynamic alignments of the auditory and motor domains based on error-prediction correction, whereas synchronization is the stable maintenance of timing during auditory-motor alignment. Methodology: A systematic literature search in databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched up to 9th of August 2017. The selection criteria for the included studies were adult populations, with a minimum of five participants, investigating walking to an auditory stimulus, with an outcome measure of entrainment, and synchronization. The review was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42017080325. Objectives: The objective of the review is to systematically describe the metrics which measure entrainment and synchronization to auditory stimuli during walking in healthy and neurological populations. Results: Sixteen articles were included. Fifty percent of the included articles had healthy controls as participants (N = 167), 19% had neurological diseases such as Huntingtons and Stroke (N = 76), and 31% included both healthy and neurological [Parkinsons disease (PD) and Stroke] participants (N = 101). In the included studies, six parameters were found to capture the interaction between the human movement and the auditory stimuli, these were: cadence, relative phase angle, resultant vector length, interval between the beat and the foot contact, period matching performance, and detrended fluctuation analysis. Conclusion: In this systematic review, several metrics have been identified, which measure the timing aspect of auditory-motor coupling and synchronization of auditory stimuli in healthy and neurological populations during walking. The application of these metrics may enhance the current state of the art and practice across the neurological gait rehabilitation. These metrics also have current shortcomings. Of particular pertinence is our recommendation to consider variability in data from a time-series rather than time-windowed viewpoint. We need it in view of the promising practical applications from which the studied populations may highly benefit in view of personalized medical care.",

However, at the same time, they critically challenge some of the most basic principles that drive human engagement and interaction with music. This article first presents a theoretical discussion of two of these principles, namely sensorimotor control and participatory sense-making. Thereafter, it presents SoundBikes, a music installation that implements these theoretical considerations. SoundBikes is rooted in the idea that collective music-making is a form of participatory sense-making that emerges from embodied, dynamical and collaborative interactions between co-performers. The core components of SoundBikes include an EMS Synthi 100 and two stationary bikes equipped with sensors. To stimulate social interaction and collaboration between cyclist-performers, we designed SoundBikes in a way that performers could exert control over expressive features in the playback of music compositions, by coordinating their (cycling) movements with one another. This functionality is integrated in a gameplayto further stimulate social collaboration and competitionand a visually attractive environmentto provide visual feedback and to create ambiance.",

In this book, Marc Leman argues that expression drives this kind of interaction, and he proposes a general framework for understanding expressive interactions. He focuses on the dynamic, fast, and pre-reflective processes underlying our interactions with music -whether we are playing an instrument, dancing, listening, or using new interactive technologies. Music offers a well-established domain for studying these fast and interactive processes, and Leman argues that understanding the power of expressive interaction through music may help us understand cognitive processing in other domains, including language, human action coordination, human-animal interaction, and human-machine interaction.Leman regards expressive interactions with music as energizing and empowering. He argues that music is based on patterns that intervene with a reinforcing loop in the human brain, strengthening learning, motivation, and reward. He argues further that the reinforcing effect is influenced by the interaction flow, by fast processes that handle expressive qualities on the fly.Leman sets out the framework in which expressive interaction is situated, describing, among other things, a pragmatic model of communication in which the fundamental components are enactment and dynamics. He looks in more detail at the cognitive-motivational architecture, discussing sensorimotor and motivational schemes. Finally, he discusses applications for the concepts behind expressive motivation in such fields as sports, entertainment, rehabilitation, multimedia art, and music education.",

                  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to assist a performer in dealing with the challenges of contemporary music performance. Such a method aims at making a performers artistic process (which is based on cognitive and sensorimotor schemes) more explicit, in order to better understand the relationship between goals, actions, and sounds. The method does not provide a heuristic that will automatically lead to a new performance model. Rather, it is meant to assist performers in (re)framing their interpretative outlooks while rendering their performative code explicit with the help of innovative mirror-like technologies. First we provide a general framework for understanding music performance, based on the notion of performance spaces and frames, and on recent insights in embodied interactions with music. Next we elaborate on how to approach the development of such understanding through performance research. Then we apply this framework to the performance of contemporary music, describing two complementary analysis approaches, in which we focus on analysis from a third-person perspective, and from a first-person perspective, respectively. The paper concludes with a discussion about the method and its value for both research and performance.",

Its first phase would consist in an overview of gestural patterning, before delving into the notorious rhythmic intricacies of this most complex notation. In the current paper, we propose a methodology for inferring such patterning from multimodal performance data. In particular, we have a) conducted qualitative analysis of the correlations between the performance data (an audio recording, 12-axis acceleration and gyroscope signals captured by inertial sensors, kinect video and MIDI) and the implicit annotation of pitch during a sight-reading performance; b) observed and documented the correspondence between patterns in the gestural signals and patterns in the score annotations and c) produced joint tablature-like representations, which inscribe the gestural patterning back into the notation, while reducing the pitch material by 70-80% of the original. In addition, we have incorporated this representation in videos and interactive multimodal tablatures via the use of INScore. Our work draws from recent studies in the fields of gesture modelling and interaction. It extends the authors previous work on an embodied model of navigation of complex notation and on an application for offline and real-time gestural control of complex notation by the name GesTCom (Gesture Cutting through Textual Complexity). Future prospects include the probabilistic modelling of gestureto-notation mappings, towards the design of interactive systems which learn along with the performer while cutting through textual complexity.",

Musical creations and performances are among the most complex and intricate of our cultural artifacts, and the emotional power of music can touch us in surprising and profound ways. In view of the rapid and sustained growth of digital music sharing and distribution, the development of computational methods to help users find and organize music information has become an important field of research in both industry and academia.  The Dagstuhl Seminar 16092 was devoted to a research area known as music structure analysis, where the general objective is to uncover patterns and relationships that govern the organization of notes, events, and sounds in music. Gathering researchers from different fields, we critically reviewed the state of the art for computational approaches to music structure analysis in order to identify the main limitations of existing methodologies. This triggered interdisciplinary discussions that leveraged insights from fields as disparate as psychology, music theory, composition, signal processing, machine learning, and information sciences to address the specific challenges of understanding structural information in music. Finally, we explored novel applications of these technologies in music and multimedia retrieval, content creation, musicology, education, and human-computer interaction.  In this report, we give an overview of the various contributions and results of the seminar. We start with an executive summary, which describes the main topics, goals, and group activities. Then, we present a list of abstracts giving a more detailed overview of the participants contributions as well as of the ideas and results discussed in the group meetings of our seminar.",

Even where composers social networks and friendships are of contextual interest, it is arguable that their association with other musicians arises because they choose to socialize with similar others. However, it is also possible that creative work, even for artists as solitary as composers, depends significantly on interaction and collaboration. Certain periods and places are considered hotspots of creativity where new musical ideas are shared and movements arise. In this paper we consider the case of British classical composition, both as an example of a music network, and to contribute to debates in music history.",

Of particular interest is the match between the musicians mental focus on musical targets (the so-called musical intentions) and the expressive (or so-called auxiliary) body movements. To what extent are these related to each other? And what does this relationship reveal about mindbody connections? To approach these questions, a case study was set up around a clarinet solo performance played from score, covering a style of music unfamiliar to the player. The clarinetists movements were recorded with an optical movement tracking system. A statistical analysis method was developed, to account for movement data in relation to the potential musical intentions and targets. The bottom-up movement analysis method was validated with the performers annotations of targets in the musical score and the performers annotations of communicative/sound facilitating gestures in the performance video. The results reveal that the mental focus on musical targets is related to bodily expression. This finding supports the idea of an embodied model of musical syntax processing, which is strongly related to corporeal gestures.",

Many techniques have been devised to make these visual representations more scalable, enabling the simultaneous display of multiple variables, as well as the multi-scale display of time-series of very high resolution or that span long time periods. There has been comparatively little research on how to support the more elaborate tasks associated with the exploratory visual analysis of timeseries, e.g., visualizing derived values, identifying correlations, or discovering anomalies beyond obvious outliers. Such tasks typically require deriving new time-series from the original data, trying different functions and parameters in an iterative manner. We introduce a novel visualization technique called ChronoLenses, aimed at supporting users in such exploratory tasks. ChronoLenses perform on-the-fly transformation of the data points in their focus area, tightly integrating visual analysis with user actions, and enabling the progressive construction of advanced visual analysis pipelines.",

Although various research-level interfaces and technologies have been developed, it has not been easy to get people to use them in everyday life. Songle serves as a showcase to demonstrate how people can benefit from music-understanding technologies by enabling people to experience active music listening interfaces on the web. Songle facilitates deeper understanding of music by visualizing music scene descriptions estimated automatically, such as music structure, hierarchical beat structure, melody line, and chords. When using music-understanding technologies, however, estimation errors are inevitable. Songle therefore features an efficient error correction interface that encourages people to contribute by correcting those errors to improve the web service. We also propose a mechanism of collaborative training for music-understanding technologies, in which corrected errors will be used to improve the music-understanding performance through machine learning techniques. We hope Songle will serve as a research platform where other researchers can exhibit results of their music-understanding technologies to jointly promote the popularization of the field of music information research.",

                  "abstract": "O VER THE PAST 25 YEARS OUR UNDERSTANDING of how music interacts with the human mind and brain has grown rapidly, and multimedia technologies have augmented the ways in which we engage with music. In Embodied Music Cognition and Mediation Technology, Marc Leman examines how these developments might be unified into something that is simultaneously a theory of music cognition and a blueprint for the music mediation technology of the future. Mediation refers to the mappings between the intentions and desires on the part of active musical participants and the technology that renders the music. The main mediating principle elaborated on in the monograph, which is more intellectual discourse than textbook, is rooted in the belief that musical interactions are socially charged, embodied affairs. Thus, individuals understand music in the same way that they understand others intentions during social interaction, and expressive intentions are attributed to music because patterns of sonic energy evoke bodily gestures that are meaningful to an individual due to his or her personal history as an active participant within a cultural environment. The first three chapters contextualize the embodied music cognition approach. In Chapter 1, Leman sets the scene by making clear the challenges that face those who are concerned with how subjective musical experiences are linked to physical sound patterns. Chapter 2 then deals with the diversity of paradigms that are relevant to the business of interdisciplinary music research. Here Leman adeptly identifies relationships between trends in music research, such as the emergence of systematic musicology, and landmark developments in the discipline of psychology, such as the advent of the Gestalt school and cognitivism. He also charts the progress made in the fields of technology, information theory, and computational modeling, with well selected philosophical matter visited along the way. This serves as a historical prelude to the birth of the modern embodied cognition paradigm, which asserts that, knowledge does not emerge from passive perception, but from the need to act in an environment (p. 43). In Chapter 3, Leman expands upon this ecological theme with a view toward music mediation technology, developing the premise that mediating technology should exploit the way in which individuals naturally engage themselves with music. The ensuing chapters delve into the details of what embodied music cognition means. Chapters 4 and 5 build a case for why it makes sense to think about engagement with music in terms of corporeal articulations and action-based ontologies, and how these lead to pleasurable experiences with music, whereas Chapters 6 and 7 describe how this type of framework might play itself out in musical instrument and music retrieval technologies. Throughout these chapters, Leman articulates a framework in which performer/music/listener interactions can be structured/mediated. The framework contends with the formidable challenges inherent in mapping between the intentions, actions, and percepts of individuals and very specific musical signals. Ultimately, the problem is one of identifying relationships between semantics and musical structure, and then specifying the technological requirements for accomplishing the translation from one to the other. Leman breaks the problem down into three interacting conceptual levels, which he talks about as first-person, second-person, and third-person descriptions. Thirdperson descriptions are objective representations of the structural features of the music, whereas first-person descriptions are subjectively assigned semantic labels that refer to expressive intentions. According to Leman, previous approaches to understanding music (e.g., traditional musicology) have fixated upon these two levels of description without giving adequate treatment to the rules that govern the mapping between objective representations and subjective interpretations. Such rules are needed to achieve his scientific goal of developing a complete theory of music, as well as his practical goal of developing a successful mediation technology. The key to Lemans solution is the proposal that an understanding of musical intentions requires third-person and first-person descriptions to be linked via second-person descriptions, which are corporeal in nature. At this intermediate level, expressive bodily gestures from an individuals repertoire of actions are used to describe moving sonic forms in a manner that the individual can interpret based on his or",

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.",

                  "abstract": "Musical genre is probably the most popular music descriptor. In the context of large musical databases and Electronic Music Distribution, genre is therefore a crucial metadata for the description of music content. However, genre is intrinsically ill-defined and attempts at defining genre precisely have a strong tendency to end up in circular, ungrounded projections of fantasies. Is genre an intrinsic attribute of music titles, as, say, tempo? Or is genre a extrinsic description of the whole piece? In this article, we discuss the various approaches in representing musical genre, and propose to classify these approaches in three main categories: manual, prescriptive and emergent approaches. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach, and illustrate our study with results of the Cuidado IST project.",

                  "abstract": "Analysis has always played a role in musicology. The analytical process, writes Arnold Whittall, and echoing a generation of structuralists, is two-fold: to identify the various materials of a composition, and to define the ways in which they function. Thus defined, analysis is indispensable to a discipline that takes the musical object as its point of departure. Not all branches of musicology demand a vigorous deployment of analytical techniques. And this is in part because not all branches of musicology are directly concerned with the experience of music. Attending to the archive (not canon) of musical works is, however, impossible without analytical mediation, itself propped up by an explicit or-more likely-implicit theory. Analysis plays an even more central role in the discipline of Music Theory. Traditionally defined, theory undertakes to codify the various materials of a composition and to exemplify their functioning in a range of works; it insists that its methods meet explicitly stated criteria of coherence; and it often proclaims aesthetic preferences,",

Hoffmann received a copy of the score to Beethovens Fifth Symphony and in July 1810, he published a review of the Fifth Symphony in the German journal for music criticism Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung. Hoffmann need not have actually heard a performance; in his review, the purely musical analysis could easily have been based entirely on his reading of the score. In its basic structure, the review follows the pattern of reviews published in the AMZ. What is groundbreaking, however, is what Hoffmann has done with the introductory portion: Hoffmann serves up a full-blown theory of musical romanticism. His idea is to put Beethoven forward as the ultimate musical romantic.",

To uncover this hidden cultural awareness about multi-genre affinity, we present a new model based on the analysis of the way in which a community of users organise artists and genres in playlists. Our work is based on a novel dataset that we have elaborated identifying the co-occurrences of artists in the playlists shared by the members of a popular Web-based community, and that is made publicly available. The analysis defines an automatic social-based method to uncover relationships between artists and genres, and introduces a series of novel concepts that characterises artists and genres in a richer way than a unique genre label would do.",

The research area of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) covers many of these aspects. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of this vast and new field. A number of issues, which are peculiar to the music language, are described--including forms, formats, and dimensions of music--together with the typologies of users and their information needs. To fulfil these needs a number of approaches are discussed, from direct search to information filtering and clustering of music documents. An overview of the techniques for music processing, which are commonly exploited in many approaches, is also presented. Evaluation and comparisons of the approaches on a common benchmark are other important issues. To this end, a description of the initial efforts and evaluation campaigns for MIR is provided.",

This text illuminates, through a representative sampling of masterworks, those themes, styles, and currents that give shape and direction to each musical age. Taking a critical perspective, this text sets the details of music, the chronological sweep of figures, works, and musical ideas, within the larger context of world affairs and cultural history. Written by an authoritative, opinionated, and controversial figure in musicology, The Oxford History of Western Music provides a critical aesthetic position with respect to individual works, a context in which each composition may be evaluated and remembered. Taruskin combines an emphasis on structure and form with a discussion of relevant theoretical concepts in each age, to illustrate how the music itself works, and how contemporaries heard and understood it. It also describes how the context of each stylistic period - key cultural, historical, social, economic, and scientific events - influenced and directed compositional choices. Unlike earlier surveys, Taruskin provides greater attention to the full range of 20th century music, including American music as part of the mainstream tradition of western music, women in music, and popular music. The five volumes of main text each have musical examples and black and white pictures throughout, source notes, and an index. The sixth volume contains a comprehensive chronology, further reading, and an index to the entire set.",

Because of the lack of standards in music classification (or the lack of enforcement of existing standards), there is a huge amount of unclassified music titles in the world. The authors propose a classification method based on a musical data mining technique based on co-occurrence and correlation analysis that can be used for classification. It gives a new approach to similarity between several titles of music or several artists. We study large corpora of textual information referring titles of music or artists whose names are decided by humans without particular constraints other than readability, and draw various hypotheses concerning the natural similarities that emerge from these corpora. Based on a clustering technique, we show that interesting groups can reveal specific music genres and allow classification of music titles in an objective manner.",

Contributing to this feeling is the difficulty attending assessment of rank relationships among the regional elements of a particular system. In the present study, logical constraints upon the meaning of a satisfactorily efficient hier- archical faunal classification are identified and operationalized into a system of world mammal faunal regions via an iterative procedure involving multi- dimensional scaling. The result is a classification consisting of four regions and ten subregions, each of the latter of which is as unique as it can be with respect to all other subregions while still contributing to logical hierarchical order rela- tionships within the system. The classification is compared to the Sclater-Wallace system and is shown to be both more efficient and more internally consistent. Summary data and statistics pertaining to the new classification are presented and briefly discussed.",

Pattern Difference is the one of most interest in taxonomy.

A similar question of homogeneity may arise if we have k samples from multinomial or Poisson distributions. This paper, which is the first of a series of two, treats the binomial and multinomial situations; the second paper will treat the Poisson case. Homogeneity tests already exist for the problems just mentioned, but these existing tests apparently were not constructed with any optimal power properties explicitly in mind. These papers approach the problem of homogeneity testing by attempting to construct tests having maximal power against certain reasonable alternative hypotheses. Some new tests result from this approach; these tests will be described and numerical illustrations will be presented. The traditional tests (i.e. the usual x2 tests) will also be discussed. For the binomial problem, all tests which are considered are applicable to the situation (frequently arising in genetics) in which some or all of the k sample sizes are small numbers (even as small as 2 or 3). Section 1 of this paper is concerned with testing for homogeneity for the binomial case; a number of biological applications are presented. In ? 3, we show briefly how the new test which is introduced in ? 1 may be generalized to the multinomial case. All of the more technical details have been relegated to the Mathematical Appendices, which form the last part of the paper.",

In this article, we present a study and subsequent tool design focused on leveraging a critics annotations as implicit interactions for initiating context-specific computational support that automatically searches external resources. We observed 14 poetry critics performing a close reading, revealing a set of cognitive practices supported through free-form annotation that have not previously been discussed in this context. We used guidelines derived from our study to design a tool, Metatation, which uses a pen-and-paper system with a peripheral display to utilize reader annotations as underspecified interactions to augment close reading. By turning paper-based annotations into implicit queries, Metatation provides relevant supplemental information in a just-in-time manner and acts as a bridge between close and distant reading.",

We argue that building visualization sandcastles provides a holistic approach to interdisciplinary knowledge generation that embraces visualization as (1) a dynamic interdisciplinary process where speculation and re-interpretation advance knowledge in all disciplines involved, (2) a mediator of ideas and theories within and across disciplines and (3) an aesthetic provocation to elicit critical insights, interpretation, speculation and discussions within and beyond scholarly audiences.

Hence, DH-projects have to overcome common challenges of multi-disciplinary research, such as methodological differences or communication issues. However, in contrast to interdisciplinary collaborations from related fields of science, in the digital humanities, a gap between qualitative scholarship traditions and quantitative data-driven research has to be bridged to achieve a common goal. With this position paper, we aim at starting a discussion between the various involved disciplines in the digital humanities on how to approach the problem-solving process in DH-projects. Based on our experience in different visual text analytics projects and extensive two years of discussions, we propose an abstract conceptual workflow as a best practice for digital humanities projects.",

At each of these levels, there is a wealth of information that can inform inquiry - from statistical models, to metadata, to the researchers own knowledge and expertise. Joining all this information together can be a challenge, and there are issues of scale to be combatted along the way. In this paper, we describe an approach to text analysis that addresses these challenges of scale and multiple information sources, using probabilistic topic models to structure exploration through multiple levels of inquiry in a way that fosters serendipitous discovery. In implementing this approach into a tool called Serendip, we incorporate topic model data and metadata into a highly reorderable matrix to expose corpus level trends; extend encodings of tagged text to illustrate probabilistic information at a passage level; and introduce a technique for visualizing individual word rankings, along with interaction techniques and new statistical methods to create links between different levels and information types. We describe example uses from both the humanities and visualization research that illustrate the benefits of our approach.",

We demonstrate visualization rhetoric as an analytical framework for understanding how design techniques that prioritize particular interpretations in visualizations that tell a story can significantly affect end-user interpretation. We draw a parallel between narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. Devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels-the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity-and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. We identify areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve understanding of visualization interpretation.",

There are, however, many potential pitfalls, especially in early music, where scores are edited in different ways: variables include clefs, note values, types of barline, and editorial accidentals. Different score editors and optical music recognition software have their own ways of storing and exporting musical data. Choice of software and file formats, and their various parameters, can thus unintentionally bias data, as can decisions on how to interpret potentially ambiguous markings in original sources. This becomes especially problematic when data from different corpora are combined for computational processing, since observed regularities and irregularities may in fact be linked with inconsistent corpus collection methodologies, internal and external, rather than the underlying music. This paper proposes guidelines, templates, and workflows for the creation of consistent early music corpora, and for detecting encoding biases in existing corpora. We have assembled a corpus of Renaissance duos as a sample implementation, and present machine learning experiments demonstrating how inconsistent or nave encoding methodologies for corpus collection can distort results.",

This paper describes the feature capabilities of music21, a general-purpose, open source toolkit for analyzing, searching, and transforming symbolic music data. The features module of music21 integrates standard featureextraction tools provided by other toolkits, includes new tools, and also allows researchers to write new and powerful extraction methods quickly. These developments take advantage of the systems built-in capacities to parse diverse data formats and to manipulate complex scores (e.g., by reducing them to a series of chords, determining key or metrical strength automatically, or integrating audio data). This papers demonstrations combine music21 with the data mining toolkits Orange and Weka to distinguish works by Monteverdi from works by Bach and German folk music from Chinese folk music.",

This dissertation focuses on the development of jMIR, a suite of powerful, flexible, accessible and original software tools that can be used to design, share and apply a wide range of automatic music classification technologies. jMIR permits users to extract meaningful information from audio recordings, symbolic musical representations and cultural information available on the Internet; to use machine learning technologies to automatically build classification models; to automatically collect profiling statistics and detect metadata errors in musical collections; to perform experiments on large, stylistically diverse and well-labelled collections of music in both audio and symbolic formats; and to store and distribute information that is essential to automatic music classification in expressive and flexible standardised file formats. In order to have as diverse a range of applications as possible, care was taken to avoid tying jMIR to any particular types of music classification. Rather, it is designed to be a general-purpose toolkit that can be applied to arbitrary types of music classification. Each of the jMIR components is also designed to be accessible not only by users with a high degree of expertise in computer-based research technologies, but also by researchers with valuable musical expertise, but perhaps less of a background in computational research. Moreover, although the jMIR software can certainly be used as a set of ready-to-use tools for solving music classification problems directly, it is also designed to serve as an open-source platform for developing and testing original algorithms. This dissertation also describes several experiments that were performed with jMIR. These experiments were intended not only to verify the effectiveness of the software, but also to investigate the utility of combining information from different types of musical data, an approach with the potential to significantly advance the performance of automatic music classification in general.",

The assumption behind such efforts is often that trends will emerge from the analysis despite errors for individual data points and that noise will be dominated by the signal in the data. However, for some text analysis tasks, the technology is unable to perform as well as domain experts, perhaps because it does not have sufficient world knowledge or metadata available. Yet, the advantage of language processing technology is that it can process at scale, even if not perfectly accurately. Geo-locating literary works is one example where human expert knowledge is invaluable when it comes to distinguishing between candidate works. This was the underlying assumption in Palimpsest, an interdisciplinary digital humanities research project on mining literary Edinburgh. From the outset, the project adopted an assisted curation process whereby the automatic processing of large data collections was combined with manual checking to identify literary works set in Edinburgh. In this article, we introduce the assisted curation process and evaluate how the feedback from literary scholars helped to improve the technology, thereby highlighting the importance of placing humanities research at the core of digital humanities projects.",

This model complies with the often ungrammatical structure of verbatim transcripts, relating two entities if they are present in the same sentence within a small distance window. Our tool enables the exploratory analysis of multiparty conversations using several linked views that reveal thematic and temporal structures in the text. In addition to distantreading, we integrated closereading views for a textlevel investigation process. Beyond the exploratory and temporal analysis of conversations, NEREx helps users generate and validate hypotheses and perform comparative analyses of multiple conversations.

While a large number of feature representations have been proposed in the literature, an effective means of combining different domains of features for MPE is still needed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, referred to as combined frequency and periodicity (CFP), that detects pitches according to the agreement of a harmonic series in the frequency domain and a subharmonic series in the lag (quefrency) domain. This approach nicely aggregates the complementary advantages of the two feature domains in different frequency ranges, and improves the robustness of the pitch detection function to the interference of the overtones of simultaneous pitches. We report a comprehensive evaluation that compares CFP against three state-of-the-art approaches using three MPE datasets and four symphonies. The evaluation is characteristic of the coverage and complexity of music (in terms of instrument type and degree of polyphony). In addition, we also evaluate the performance of the MPE approaches when a number of audio degradations are applied. Results show that the proposed unsupervised method performs consistently well across the types of Western polyphonic music considered, and is robust to audio degradations such as high-pass filtering and MP3 compression.",

Different kinds of features have been employed as input to classification models which have been shown to achieve high accuracy in classification scenarios under controlled environments. In this work, we investigate two components of the music genre classification process: a novel feature vector obtained directly from a description of the musical structure described in MIDI files (named as structural features), and the performance of relational classifiers compared to the traditional ones. Neither structural features nor relational classifiers have been previously applied to the music genre classification problem. Our hypotheses are: (i) the structural features provide a more effective description than those currently employed in automatic music genre classification tasks, and (ii) relational classifiers can outperform traditional algorithms, as they operate on graph models of the data that embed information on the similarity between music tracks. Results from experiments carried out on a music dataset with unbalanced distribution of genres indicate these hypotheses are promising and deserve further investigation.",

In some languages, his plays have been retranslated many times. These translations and retranslations have evolved for about 250 years. Studying variations in translations of world cultural heritage texts is of cross-cultural interest for arts and humanities researchers. The variations between retranslations are due to numerous factors, including the differing purposes of translations, genetic relations, cultural and intercultural influences, rivalry between translators and their varying competence. A team of Digital Humanities researchers has collected an experimental corpus of 55 different German retranslations of Shakespeares play, Othello. The retranslations date between 1766 and 2010. A sub-corpus of 32 retranslations has been prepared as a digital parallel corpus. We would like to develop methods of exploring patterns in variation between different translations. In this article, we develop an interactive focus + context visualization system to present, analyse and explore variation at the level of user-defined segments. From our visualization, we are able to obtain an overview of the relationships of similarity between parallel segments in different versions. We can uncover clusters and outliers at various scales, and a linked focus view allows us to further explore the textual details behind these findings. The domain experts who are studying this topic evaluate our visualizations, and we report their feedback. Our system helps them better understand the relationships between different German retranslations of Othello and derive some insight.",

KelpFusion is a hybrid representation that bridges hull techniques such as Bubble Sets and Euler diagrams and line- and graph-based techniques such as LineSets and Kelp Diagrams. We describe an algorithm based on shortest-path graphs to compute KelpFusion visualizations. Based on a single parameter, the shortest-path graph varies from the minimal spanning tree to the convex hull of a point set. Shortest-path graphs aim to capture the shape of a point set and smoothly adapt to sets of varying densities. KelpFusion fills enclosed faces based on a set of simple legibility rules. We present the results of a controlled experiment comparing KelpFusion to Bubble Sets and LineSets. We conclude that KelpFusion outperforms Bubble Sets both in accuracy and completion time and outperforms LineSets in completion time.",

We propose that above and beyond a general graph-based data model, which is becoming increasingly popular in many complex annotation formats, a well-defined concept of multiple, potentially conflicting segmentation layers must be introduced to deal with different sources and applications of corpus data flexibly. We also propose a generic solution for specialized corpus visualizations in a Web interface using annotation-triggered style sheets, which leverage the power of modern browsers and CSS for multiple and highly customizable views of primary data. We offer an implementation and evaluation of our architecture in ANNIS3, an open-source browser-based architecture for corpus search and visualization. We present three case studies to test the coverage of the system, encompassing core linguistic and digital humanities use-cases including richly annotated newspaper treebanks, multilingual diplomatic and normalized manuscript materials edited in TEI, and analysis of multimodal recordings of spoken language.",

A major shortcoming of current automated plagiarism detection approaches is their dependence on high characterbased similarity. As a result, heavily disguised plagiarism forms, such as paraphrases, translated plagiarism, or structural and idea plagiarism, remain undetected. A recently proposed languageindependent approach to plagiarism detection, Citationbased Plagiarism Detection (CbPD), allows the detection of semantic similarity even in the absence of text overlap by analyzing the citation placement in a documents full text to determine similarity. This article evaluates the performance of CbPD in detecting plagiarism with various degrees of disguise in a collection of 185,000 biomedical articles. We benchmark CbPD against two characterbased detection approaches using a ground truth approximated in a user study. Our evaluation shows that the citationbased approach achieves superior ranking performance for heavily disguised plagiarism forms. Additionally, we demonstrate CbPD to be computationally more efficient than characterbased approaches. Finally, upon combining the citationbased with the traditional characterbased document similarity visualization methods in a hybrid detection prototype, we observe a reduction in the required user effort for document verification.",

The pre-WOM brand attitude certainty is expected to explain the moderation effect. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach  Two experiments were conducted. The study participants were undergraduate students from a major university in Singapore. The main statistical analysis was done using a two-way analysis of covariance. Findings  The results of Experiments 1 and 2 support the prediction that consumers are more likely to use the perceived expertise of the WOM sender to evaluate an unfamiliar brand vs a familiar brand. Experiment 2 also provides some preliminary evidence that this interaction effect may be due to the difference in certainty of the study respondents in regards to the pre-WOM evaluation of unfamiliar and familiar brand.

This was done via a series of genre classification experiments performed using all seven possible combinations and subsets of the three corresponding types of features. These experiments were performed using jMIR, a software suite designed for use both as a toolset for performing MIR research and as a platform for developing and sharing new algorithms. The experimental results indicate that combining feature types can indeed substantively improve classification accuracy. Accuracies of 96.8% and 78.8% were attained respectively on 5 and 10-class genre taxonomies when all three feature types were combined, compared to average respective accuracies of 85.5% and 65.1% when features extracted from only one of the three sources of data were used. It was also found that combining feature types decreased the seriousness of those misclassifications that were made, on average, particularly when cultural features were included.",

                  "abstract": "GUIDO Music Notation is a novel approach for adequately representing score-level music. Based on a simple, yet powerful and easily extensible formalism, GUIDO is realised as a plain-text, human-readable and platform independent format. The key feature of our design is representational adequacy: simple musical concepts can be expressed in a simple way, while complex musical notions may require more complex representations. GUIDO Notation can be used for a broad range of applications, including notation software, compositional and analytical systems and tools, music databases, and music on the WWW. Introduction and Background The GUIDO Music Notation Format is a novel, general purpose formal language for representing score level music in a platform independent, plain-text and human-readable way. The GUIDO design concentrates on general musical concepts (as opposed to only notational, i.e., graphical features). Its key feature is representational adequacy, meaning that simple musical concepts should be represented in a simple way and only complex notions should require complex representations. The GUIDO design is organised in three layers: Basic, Advanced, and Extended GUIDO Music Notation. Basic GUIDO introduces the basic GUIDO syntactical structures and covers basic musical notions; Advanced GUIDO extends this layer to support exact score formatting and more sophisticated musical concepts; and Extended GUIDO introduces features which are beyond conventional music notation. GUIDO Music Notation is designed as a exible and easily extensible open standard. Thus, it can be easily adapted and customised to cover specialised musical concepts as might be required in the context of research projects in computational musicology. GUIDO has not been developed with a particular application in mind but to provide an adequate representation formalism for score-level music over a broad range of applications. The intended application areas include notation software, compositional and analytical systems and tools, musical databases, performance systems, and music on the WWW. Comparing GUIDO to other music representation formalisms, several di erences can be found: Unlike the MIDI File Format [Hewlett, Selfridge 1997] or NIFF [Grande, Belkin; 1996], GUIDO is a plain-text, human-readable format. This facilitates the realisation of GUIDO support for music software and has considerable advantages for using GUIDO to interchange musical data between applications or across platforms and over the internet. Compared to other plain-text approaches like DARMS [Selfridge; 1997], SMDL [Sloan; 1997], or music representations based on HTML or XML, GUIDO shows improved representational adequacy (in the sense de ned above) which again facilitates its usage and implementation. Finally, in contrast to representations which are speci cally designed for graphic music notation, like Common Music Notation (cmn) [Schottstaedt; 1997], the GUIDO design is focussed on musical information, while also supporting exact score formatting features. Therefore, we believe that GUIDO is equally well suited for score setting and other music applications. In this respect, GUIDO follows a similar goal to DARMS, which was used for a wide range of applications until the early 1980s.

                  "abstract": "When human listeners are confronted with musical sounds, they rapidly and automatically orient themselves in the music. Even musically untrained listeners have an exceptional ability to make rapid judgments about music from very short examples, such as determining the musics style, performer, beat, complexity, and emotional impact. However, there are presently no theories of music perception that can explain this behavior, and it has proven very difficult to build computer music-analysis tools with similar capabilities. This dissertation examines the psychoacoustic origins of the early stages of music listening in humans, using both experimental and computer-modeling approaches. The results of this research enable the construction of automatic machine-listening systems that can make human-like judgments about short musical stimuli. New models are presented that explain the perception of musical tempo, the perceived segmentation of sound scenes into multiple auditory images, and the extraction of musical features from complex musical sounds. These models are implemented as signal-processing and pattern-recognition computer programs, using the principle of understanding without separation. Two experiments with human listeners study the rapid assignment of high-level judgments to musical stimuli, and it is demonstrated that many of the experimental results can be explained with a multiple-regression model on the extracted musical features. From a theoretical standpoint, the thesis shows how theories of music perception can be grounded in a principled way upon psychoacoustic models in a computational-auditory-sceneanalysis framework. Further, the perceptual theory presented is more relevant to everyday listeners and situations than are previous cognitive-structuralist approaches to music perception and cognition. From a practical standpoint, the various models form a set of computer signal-processing and pattern-recognition tools that can mimic human perceptual abilities on a variety of musical tasks such as tapping along with the beat, parsing music into sections, making semantic judgments about musical examples, and estimating the similarity of two pieces of music.

The existing evaluations of designs that facilitate these comparisons tend to be based on intuitive reasoning, rather than quantifiable measures. We build on this work with a series of crowdsourced experiments that use low-level perceptual comparison tasks that arise frequently in comparisons within data visualizations (e.g., which value changes the most between the two sets of data?). Participants completed these tasks across a variety of layouts: overlaid, two arrangements of juxtaposed small multiples, mirror-symmetric small multiples, and animated transitions. A staircase procedure sought the difficulty level (e.g., value change delta) that led to equivalent accuracy for each layout. Confirming prior intuition, we observe high levels of performance for overlaid versus standard small multiples. However, we also find performance improvements for both mirror symmetric small multiples and animated transitions. While some results are incongruent with common wisdom in data visualization, they align with previous work in perceptual psychology, and thus have potentially strong implications for visual comparison designs.",

Despite decades of past work on VQSs, these efforts have not translated to adoption in practice, possibly because VQSs are largely evaluated in unrealistic lab-based settings. To remedy this gap in adoption, we collaborated with experts from three diverse domainsastronomy, genetics, and material sciencevia a year-long user-centered design process to develop a VQS that supports their workflow and analytical needs, and evaluate how VQSs can be used in practice. Our study results reveal that ad-hoc sketch-only querying is not as commonly used as prior work suggests, since analysts are often unable to precisely express their patterns of interest. In addition, we characterize three essential sensemaking processes supported by our enhanced VQS. We discover that participants employ all three processes, but in different proportions, depending on the analytical needs in each domain. Our findings suggest that all three sensemaking processes must be integrated in order to make future VQSs useful for a wide range of analytical inquiries.",

Our approach enables users to (1) understand the semantic space of the model, (2) identify regions of potential conflicts and problems, and (3) readjust the semantic relation of concepts based on their understanding, directly influencing the topic modeling. These tasks are supported by an interactive visual analytics workspace that uses word-embedding projections to define concept regions which can then be refined. The user-refined concepts are independent of a particular document collection and can be transferred to related corpora. All user interactions within the concept space directly affect the semantic relations of the underlying vector space model, which, in turn, change the topic modeling. In addition to direct manipulation, our system guides the users decision-making process through recommended interactions that point out potential improvements. This targeted refinement aims at minimizing the feedback required for an efficient human-in-the-loop process. We confirm the improvements achieved through our approach in two user studies that show topic model quality improvements through our visual knowledge externalization and learning process.",

For learners it can be a time-consuming and tedious task due to the steep learning curve. The idea throughout this paper is to visually annotate musical compositions with the objective to support users in performing the harmonic analysis, in which the task is mainly based on the identification of similar tonalities and relevant degrees. The paper proposes two visualisations that use rectangles to represent tonalities and the degree and exploit colours to represent similarities. The design of visualisations is based on guidelines drawn from informal interviews with teachers of the Conservatorio G. Martucci, a conservatory in Salerno, and from literature. The evaluation study by involving 30 participants showed that overall the 30 participants of the evaluation study achieved better results performing the harmonic analysis using the musical composition enhanced with visualisations compared to the standard musical composition; it is a promising result that encourages further investigation in the field.",

To this end, we propose a visual analytics workflow to help data scientists and domain experts explore, diagnose, and understand the decisions made by a binary classifier. The approach leverages instance-level explanations, measures of local feature relevance that explain single instances, and uses them to build a set of visual representations that guide the users in their investigation. The workflow is based on three main visual representations and steps: one based on aggregate statistics to see how data distributes across correct / incorrect decisions; one based on explanations to understand which features are used to make these decisions; and one based on raw data, to derive insights on potential root causes for the observed patterns. The workflow is derived from a long-term collaboration with a group of machine learning and healthcare professionals who used our method to make sense of machine learning models they developed. The case study from this collaboration demonstrates that the proposed workflow helps experts derive useful knowledge about the model and the phenomena it describes, thus experts can generate useful hypotheses on how a model can be improved.",

Such objects, for example, multi-valued registers (MVRs), do not have sequential specifications. This paper explores a recent model for replicated data stores that can be used to precisely specify causalconsistency for such objects, and liveness properties like eventual consistency, without revealing details of the underlying implementation. The model is used to prove the following results: 1) An eventually consistent data store implementing MVRs cannot satisfy a consistency model strictly stronger than observable causal consistency (OCC). OCC is a model somewhat stronger than causal consistency, which captures executions in which client observations can use causality to infer concurrency of operations. This result holds under certain assumptions about the data store. 2) Under the same assumptions, an eventually consistent and causally consistent replicated data store must send messages of size linear in the size of the system: Ifs objects, each (lg k)-bit in size, are supported by n replicas, then there is an execution in which an (min{n, s}lg k)-bit message is sent.",

Previous attempts to use algorithmic tools in this field focused typically on tempo and dynamics alone. We base our analysis on ten different performance categories (such as bowing, vibrato and durations). We adapt phylogenetic analysis tools to resolve the inherent inconsistencies between these categories, and describe the relationships between performances. Taking samples from 29 different performances of two pieces from Bachs sonatas for solo violin, we construct a phylogenetic tree, representing the relationship between those performances. The tree supports several interesting relations previously conjectured by the musicology community, such as the importance of date of birth and recording period in determining interpretative style. Our work also highlights some unexpected inter-connections between performers, and challenges previous assumptions regarding the significance of educational background and affiliation to the historically informed performance (HIP) style.",

Testing on deadpan and expressive piano renditions of pieces, we compared pattern discovery performance against runs on symbolic representations of the same pieces. Comparing deadpan audio with deadpan-symbolic representations, establishment precision and recall fell by  25%, and by  50% when comparing expressive audio with deadpan-symbolic representations.

In the field study, three displays were installed during three weeks in shop windows, and data about 502 interaction sessions were collected. Our observations show: (1) Significantly more passers-by interact when immediately showing the mirrored user image (+90%) or silhouette (+47%) compared to a traditional attract sequence with call-to-action. (2) Passers-by often notice interactivity late and have to walk back to interact (the landing effect). (3) If somebody is already interacting, others begin interaction behind the ones already interacting, forming multiple rows (the honeypot effect).

Since sorting is one of the most common analytical tasks performed on individual attributes of a multi-dimensional dataset, this motivates the hypothesis that introducing glyph sorting would significantly enhance the usability of glyph-based visualization. In this article, we present a glyph-based conceptual framework as part of a visualization process for interactive sorting of multivariate data. We examine several technical aspects of glyph sorting and provide design principles for developing effective, visually sortable glyphs. Glyphs that are visually sortable provide two key benefits: (1) performing comparative analysis of multiple attributes between glyphs and (2) to support multi-dimensional visual search. We describe a system that incorporates focus and context glyphs to control sorting in a visually intuitive manner and for viewing sorted results in an interactive, multi-dimensional glyph plot that enables users to perform high-dimensional sorting, analyse and examine data trends in detail. To demonstrate the usability of glyph sorting, we present a case study in rugby event analysis for comparing and analysing trends within matches. This work is undertaken in conjunction with a national rugby team. From using glyph sorting, analysts have reported the discovery of new insight beyond traditional match analysis.",

By separating specification from execution, declarative languages can simplify development, enable unobtrusive optimization, and support retargeting across platforms. We describe the design of the Protovis specification language and its implementation within an object-oriented, statically-typed programming language (Java). We demonstrate how to support rich visualizations without requiring a toolkit-specific data model and extend Protovis to enable declarative specification of animated transitions. To support cross-platform deployment, we introduce rendering and event-handling infrastructures decoupled from the runtime platform, letting designers retarget visualization specifications (e.g., from desktop to mobile phone) with reduced effort. We also explore optimizations such as runtime compilation of visualization specifications, parallelized execution, and hardware-accelerated rendering. We present benchmark studies measuring the performance gains provided by these optimizations and compare performance to existing Java-based visualization tools, demonstrating scalability improvements exceeding an order of magnitude.",

A few existing ones based on meter or rhythm characteristics have been recently proposed but they require a precise analysis, or they rely on a low-level descriptor. In this paper, we propose a midlevel descriptor: the Meter Class Profile (MCP). The MCP is centered on the tempo and represents the strength of beat multiples, including the measure rate, and the beat subdivisions. The MCP coefficients are estimated by means of the autocorrelation and the Fourier transform of the onset detection curve. Experiments on synthetic and real databases are presented, and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the MCP descriptor in clustering and retrieval of songs according to their metric properties.",

The industrial revolution challenged this compatibility because many individuals worked and lived in inhumane conditions. The technological revolution provides another (less compelling) challenge to this compatibility. Donald A. Normans goal is to help relieve feelings of incompatibility by putting the blame on the poor design of everyday things in our environment rather than on ourselves. When we fail to deal appropriately with our environment of water faucets, doors, and VCRs, we usually blame ourselves. Norman demonstrates that much of the blame should be placed on the designer and, in so doing, illustrates once again that psychology is relevant to our everyday life. Theories developed and tested in the laboratory can be used to rationalize behavioral successes and failures in everyday life. Although the book seeks to show that the incompatibility is due to the environment and not the participant, it does not address the reason that we blame ourselves. Perhaps our psychology might also speak to this issue as well as the other.",

The description of form consists of a segmentation of the piece into musical parts, grouping of the segments representing the same part, and assigning musically meaningful labels, such as ldquochorusrdquo or ldquoverse,rdquo to the groups. The method uses a fitness function for the descriptions to select the one with the highest match with the acoustic properties of the input piece. Different aspects of the input signal are described with three acoustic features: mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, chroma, and rhythmogram. The features are used to estimate the probability that two segments in the description are repeats of each other, and the probabilities are used to determine the total fitness of the description. Creating the candidate descriptions is a combinatorial problem and a novel greedy algorithm constructing descriptions gradually is proposed to solve it. The group labeling utilizes a musicological model consisting of N-grams. The proposed method is evaluated on three data sets of musical pieces with manually annotated ground truth. The evaluations show that the proposed method is able to recover the structural description more accurately than the state-of-the-art reference method.",

                  "abstract": "Symmetric second-order tensor fields play a central role in scientific and biomedical studies as well as in image analysis and feature-extraction methods. The utility of displaying tensor field samples has driven the development of visualization techniques that encode the tensor shape and orientation into the geometry of a tensor glyph. With some exceptions, these methods work only for positive-definite tensors (i.e. having positive eigenvalues, such as diffusion tensors). We expand the scope of tensor glyphs to all symmetric second-order tensors in two and three dimensions, gracefully and unambiguously depicting any combination of positive and negative eigenvalues. We generalize a previous method of superquadric glyphs for positive-definite tensors by drawing upon a larger portion of the superquadric shape space, supplemented with a coloring that indicates the tensors quadratic form. We show that encoding arbitrary eigenvalue sign combinations requires design choices that differ fundamentally from those in previous work on traceless tensors (arising in the study of liquid crystals). Our method starts with a design of 2-D tensor glyphs guided by principles of symmetry and continuity, and creates 3-D glyphs that include the 2-D glyphs in their axis-aligned cross-sections. A key ingredient of our method is a novel way of mapping from the shape space of three-dimensional symmetric second-order tensors to the unit square. We apply our new glyphs to stress tensors from mechanics, geometry tensors and Hessians from image analysis, and rate-of-deformation tensors in computational fluid dynamics.",

For example, the user may have accidentally deleted an icon or a remote collaborator may have changed settings in a control panel. Animated transitions can help, but they force users to wait for the animation to complete. This can be cumbersome, especially in situations where users did not need an explanation. We propose a different approach. Phosphor objects show the outcome of their transition instantly; at the same time they explain their change in retrospect. Manipulating a phosphor slider, for example, leaves an afterglow that illustrates how the knob moved. The parallelism of instant outcome and explanation supports both types of users. Users who already understood the transition can continue interacting without delay, while those who are inexperienced or may have been distracted can take time to view the effects at their own pace. We present a framework of transition designs for widgets, icons, and objects in drawing programs.

                  "abstract": "A theory of expectations is used to explain how music evokes various emotions for readers interested in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology as well as music. The psychological theory of expectation that David Huron proposes in Sweet Anticipation grew out of experimental efforts to understand how music evokes emotions. These efforts evolved into a general theory of expectation that will prove informative to readers interested in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology as well as those interested in music. The book describes a set of psychological mechanisms and illustrates how these mechanisms work in the case of music. All examples of notated music can be heard on the Web. Huron proposes that emotions evoked by expectation involve five functionally distinct response systems: reactive responses (which engage defensive reflexes); tension responses (where uncertainty leads to stress); predictive responses (which reward accurate prediction); imaginative responses (which facilitate deferred gratification); and appraisal responses (which occur after conscious thought is engaged). For real-world events, these five response systems typically produce a complex mixture of feelings. The book identifies some of the aesthetic possibilities afforded by expectation, and shows how common musical devices (such as syncopation, cadence, meter, tonality, and climax) exploit the psychological opportunities. The theory also provides new insights into the physiological psychology of awe, laughter, and spine-tingling chills.

It begins by defining those elements that appear in the models in the three papers that follow. A brief review is given of psychological results demonstrating that these music-theoretic definitions describe implicit knowledge that listeners have of tonal-harmonic music. This is followed by a brief historical summary of maps that were proposed previously of keys, tones, and chords, and a hybrid tone-chord map. The article then summarizes a number of issues that arise in connection with geometric representations. Finally, the innovations in the three proposed models are highlighted, particularly their contributions to visualizing the dynamics and temporal relationships that exist in extended musical pieces.",

The properties we examine are key frequencies and average time in key, and we propose two metrics, based on the L and L norms, for quantifying similarity using these descriptors. The methods are applied to 711 classical themes and variations over 71 variation sets by 10 composers of different genres. Quantile-quantile plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov measure show that the proposed metrics exhibit strongly distinct behaviour when assessing pieces from the same variation set, and those that are not. Comparisons across variation sets by the same composer, and comparisons of pieces by different composers although result in similar distributions, are derived from fundamentally different underlying distributions, according to the K-S measure. We present probabilistic analyses of the two methods based on the distributions derived empirically. When the discrimination threshold is set at 55, the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors are 18.41% and 20.56% respectively for Method 1, and 15.72% and 22.94% respectively for Method 2. Method 1 has a success rate of 99.48% when labeling pieces as dissimilar (not from the same variation set), while the corresponding rate for Method 2 is 99.45%.",

The main problem is that musical parallelism itself is difficult to formalize. In this study, a computational model that extracts melodic patterns from a given melodic surface is presented. Following the assumption that the beginning and ending points of significant repeating musical patterns influence the segmentation of a musical surface, the discovered patterns are used as am eans to determine probable segmentation points of the melody. Significant patterns are defined primarily in terms of frequency of occurrence and length of pattern. The special status of nonoverlapping, immediately repeating patterns is examined. All the discovered patterns merge into a single pattern segmentation profile that signifies points in the surface most likely to be perceived as points of segmentation. The effectiveness of the proposed melodic representations and algorithms is tested against a series of melodic surfaces illustrating both strengths and weaknesses of the approach.",

The beat spectrum is a measure of acoustic self-similarity as a function of time lag. Highly structured or repetitive music will have strong beat spectrum peaks at the repetition times. This reveals both tempo and the relative strength of particular beats, and therefore can distinguish between different kinds of rhythms at the same tempo. We also introduce the beat spectrogram which graphically illustrates rhythm variation over time. Unlike previous approaches to tempo analysis, the beat spectrum does not depend on particular attributes such as energy or frequency, and thus will work for any music or audio in any genre. We present tempo estimation results which are accurate to within 1% for a variety of musical genres. This approach has a variety of applications, including music retrieval by similarity and automatically generating music videos. Anyone who has ever tapped a foot in time to music has performed rhythm analysis. Though simple for humans, this task is considerably more difficult to automate. We introduce a new measure of tempo analysis called the beat spectrum. This is a measure of acoustic self-similarity versus lag time, computed from a representation of spectrally similarity. Peaks in the beat spectrum correspond to major rhythmic components of the source audio. The repetition time of each component can be determined by the lag time of the corresponding peak, while the relative amplitudes of different peaks reflects the strengths of their corresponding rhythmic components. We also present the beat spectrogram which graphically illustrates rhythmic variation over time. The beat spectrogram is an image formed from the beat spectrum over successive windows. Strong rhythmic components are visible as bright bars in the beat spectrogram, making changes in tempo or time signature visible. In addition, a measure of audio novelty can be computed that measures how novel the source audio is at any time [2]. Instances when this measure is large correspond to significant audio changes. Periodic peaks correspond to rhythmic periodicity in the music. In the final section, we present various applications of the beat spectrum, including music retrieval by rhythmic similarity, an automatic DJ that can smoothly sequence music with similar tempos and automatic music video generation.",

Yet, they still face an important challenge, that of long-term structure, which is key to conveying a sense of musical coherence. We present the MorpheuS music generation system designed to tackle this problem. MorpheuS novel framework has the ability to generate polyphonic pieces with a given tension profile and long- and short-term repeated pattern structures. A mathematical model for tonal tension quantifies the tension profile and state-of-the-art pattern detection algorithms extract repeated patterns in a template piece. An efficient optimization metaheuristic, variable neighborhood search, generates music by assigning pitches that best fit the prescribed tension profile to the template rhythm while hard constraining long-term structure through the detected patterns. This ability to generate affective music with specific tension profile and long-term structure is particularly useful in a game or film music context. Music generated by the MorpheuS system has been performed live in concerts.",

An RNN is first pre-trained on data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and the probability distribution over the next token in the sequence learned by this model is treated as a prior policy. Another RNN is then trained using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate higher-quality outputs that account for domain-specific incentives while retaining proximity to the prior policy of the MLE RNN. To formalize this objective, we derive novel off-policy RL methods for RNNs from KL-control. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two applications; 1) generating novel musical melodies, and 2) computational molecular generation. For both problems, we show that the proposed method improves the desired properties and structure of the generated sequences, while maintaining information learned from data.",

However, typical algorithmic approaches to structural annotation produce flat temporal partitions of a track, which are commonly evaluated against a similarly flat, human-produced annotation. Evaluating structure analysis as represented by flat annotations effectively discards all notions of structural depth in the evaluation. Although collections of hierarchical structure annotations have been recently published, no techniques yet exist to measure an algorithms accuracy against these rich structural annotations. In this work, we propose a method to evaluate structural boundary detection with hierarchical annotations. The proposed method transforms boundary detection into a ranking problem, and facilitates the comparison of both flat and hierarchical annotations. We demonstrate the behavior of the proposed method with various synthetic and real examples drawn from the SALAMI dataset.",

Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.",

After the spring semester was over, two other guys and I squeezed into a Volkswagen Beetle and headed north. Earlier, between the fall and spring semesters, we had made a trip through Southern Europe, the world like the three lost American greenhorns we were. The cultural experiences were varied and captivating, and they whetted our appetites for more. So now it was time to take a look at Northern Europe. Our destination was the northernmost tip of Norway (Nordkap was it?), where we could watch the midnight sun not set over the ocean. We made it. It was a trip worth remembering for many reasons. For one thing, we stayed in a youth hostel near our destination. Most youth hostels at that time had a curfew of 10:00 or 11:00 in the evening, an issue that had the potential of throwing a monkey wrench into our well-laid plans to watch the midnight sun. We checked with the hosts of the hostel, who were at the time sitting around their dining room table after their evening meal carrying on pleasant conversation.  Would it be alright if we went to watch the midnight sun?  we wondered.  Of course, of course!   Well, how would we get back into the hostel on our return?   Oh, dont worry. Well still be up.   Really? At two in the morning? Man, when do you all sleep?  After the slightly wearied pause of one who has had to answer this question innumerable times:  In the winter.  Indeed, when we got back from our excursion, people of all ages were walking the streets of the small town as if it were two in the afternoon rather than two in the morning. And back at the hostel our host family was still seated pretty much in their same positions around the same table, still talking in the same language. That was one more new fascinating cultural experience to tuck away. But there was another memorable part to the venture that evening that involved only us three Americans. The weather was perfect.
